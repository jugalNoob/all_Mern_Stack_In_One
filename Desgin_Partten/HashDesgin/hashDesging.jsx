Consistent Hashing: System Design and Use Cases
What is Consistent Hashing?
Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique that minimizes reorganization when nodes are added or removed from a system, making it particularly useful for distributed caching systems and load balancing.

Key Use Cases
1. Distributed Caching Systems
Example: Memcached, Redis clusters

Benefit: When cache servers are added/removed, only a fraction of keys need to be remapped

Implementation: Cache keys are distributed across servers using consistent hashing ring

2. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
Example: Cloudflare, Akamai

Benefit: Efficiently routes user requests to the nearest edge server while maintaining cache locality

Implementation: Content is partitioned across edge locations using consistent hashing

3. Load Balancers
Example: NGINX, HAProxy with consistent hashing modules

Benefit: Sticky sessions where client requests are consistently routed to the same backend server

Implementation: Client IP or session ID is hashed to determine backend server

4. Distributed Databases
Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB

Benefit: Data partitioning that minimizes movement when nodes join/leave the cluster

Implementation: Partition keys are mapped to nodes via consistent hashing ring

5. Peer-to-Peer Networks
Example: Chord protocol, BitTorrent DHT

Benefit: Efficient lookup and routing in decentralized networks

Implementation: Nodes and resources are placed on a consistent hashing ring

How It Solves Problems
Horizontal Scaling: Adding/removing nodes affects only neighboring nodes in the ring, not the entire system

Hotspot Prevention: Virtual nodes help distribute load more evenly

Minimal Data Movement: Only K/N keys need remapping when adding a node (where K=keys, N=nodes)

Deterministic Placement: Same key always maps to the same node(s)

Implementation Considerations
Virtual Nodes: Used to ensure more even distribution of load

Replication Factor: Data is typically replicated to the next N nodes in the ring for fault tolerance

Hash Function Choice: MD5, SHA-1, or other stable hash functions are commonly used

Consistent hashing is particularly valuable in any distributed system where you need to minimize reorganization costs while maintaining predictable key distribution.

Using Consistent Hashing with REST APIs and MongoDB
Yes, you can absolutely use consistent hashing in a REST API system with MongoDB, but there are specific scenarios where it makes the most sense. Here's how to implement it and when to use it:

When to Use Consistent Hashing with MongoDB REST APIs
1. Sharded MongoDB Clusters
MongoDB already uses a form of consistent hashing for its sharding

Your REST API can leverage this by:

Designing shard keys that match your access patterns

Ensuring related data lives on the same shard

2. Cache Layer for Your REST API
Implement a distributed cache (Redis/Memcached) in front of MongoDB

Use consistent hashing to:

javascript
// Example: Node.js with consistent-hashing library
const ConsistentHashing = require('consistent-hashing');
const ring = new ConsistentHashing(['cache-server-1', 'cache-server-2']);

function getCacheServer(userId) {
  return ring.getNode(userId);
}
3. Microservices Load Balancing
When your REST API is split across multiple service instances

Use consistent hashing in your API gateway:

nginx
# NGINX configuration example
upstream backend {
  hash $request_uri consistent;
  server backend1.example.com;
  server backend2.example.com;
}
Implementation Patterns
1. Direct MongoDB Sharding
javascript
// Enable sharding for a collection with good shard key
sh.shardCollection("mydb.mycol", { userId: "hashed" });

// Your REST API can now route efficiently
app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
  // MongoDB driver will automatically route to correct shard
  db.collection('users').findOne({ userId: req.params.userId });
});
2. Custom Data Partitioning
javascript
// When you need more control than MongoDB's built-in sharding
const ring = new ConsistentHashing(mongoShardServers);

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  const shard = ring.getNode(req.body.partitionKey);
  const conn = getMongoConnectionForShard(shard);
  conn.insert(req.body);
});
When NOT to Use Consistent Hashing
Small datasets that fit on a single server

Simple CRUD APIs without scaling needs

When MongoDB's built-in sharding already meets your needs

Best Practices
Choose proper shard keys (high cardinality, frequently queried)

Monitor hotspotting - use virtual nodes if needed

Combine with replication for high availability

Consider MongoDB Atlas if you want managed sharding

For most REST APIs, MongoDB's built-in sharding is sufficient, but for advanced scenarios (especially with caching layers or custom partitioning), consistent hashing can be valuable.
