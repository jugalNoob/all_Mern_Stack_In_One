Best Design Patterns in Real-World Systems
Here are some of the most impactful design patterns used in production systems, with real-world examples:

1. Microservices Pattern
Example: Netflix, Uber, Amazon

Why: Enables independent scaling, deployment, and technology choices

Implementation: Breaking monolithic apps into domain-specific services (payment service, user service, inventory service)

2. Event-Driven Architecture
Example: LinkedIn (activity feeds), Robinhood (market data processing)

Why: Loose coupling and real-time processing

Implementation: Kafka for event streaming, with producers/consumers

3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Example: Banking systems, Trading platforms

Why: Optimizes read/write workloads separately

Implementation: Separate write-optimized DB (transactions) and read-optimized DB (reporting)

4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Example: All major cloud services (AWS, Azure)

Why: Prevents cascading failures

Implementation: Hystrix (Netflix), resilience4j libraries

5. Sharding Pattern
Example: Instagram (user data sharding), Uber (geographic sharding)

Why: Horizontal scaling of databases

Implementation: Consistent hashing for data distribution

6. Materialized View Pattern
Example: Amazon product listings, Financial dashboards

Why: Pre-compute expensive queries

Implementation: Database views or dedicated read stores

7. Leader-Follower Pattern
Example: Redis Cluster, Kafka Brokers

Why: High availability and fault tolerance

Implementation: ZooKeeper for leader election

8. Sidecar Pattern
Example: Kubernetes (service meshes like Istio)

Why: Extend application functionality without modification

Implementation: Containers that run alongside main containers

9. Bulkhead Pattern
Example: Banking systems (isolating payment processing)

Why: Isolate failures in one component from others

Implementation: Thread pools per service/feature

10. Backend for Frontend (BFF)
Example: Spotify (different APIs for web vs mobile)

Why: Optimize payloads for specific clients

Implementation: API gateways with client-specific endpoints

11. Strangler Fig Pattern
Example: Microsoft's migration to Azure, many bank modernizations

Why: Gradually replace legacy systems

Implementation: Proxy that routes between old and new systems

12. Cell Architecture
Example: AWS, Facebook (known as "region sharding")

Why: Contain failures to small segments

Implementation: Independent stacks per geographic cell

These patterns are often combined in production systems. For example:

Uber combines: Microservices + Event-Driven + Sharding + Circuit Breaker

Netflix combines: Microservices + Circuit Breaker + Bulkhead + Sidecar

The best pattern depends on your specific requirements around scalability, reliability, and operational
