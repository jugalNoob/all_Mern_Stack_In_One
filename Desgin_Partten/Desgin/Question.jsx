11. Design a live location tracking system like Uber (MERN + Socket.IO)
Concepts: Geo-indexing, Socket.IO rooms, MongoDB geospatial queries

12. How would you design a notification system (email/SMS/push)?
Message Queue: Kafka/RabbitMQ, retry logic, worker queues (BullMQ)

13. How would you ensure data consistency across microservices?
Solutions: Event sourcing, eventual consistency, idempotency, outbox pattern

14. Design a system like Instagram in MERN.
Include: Media uploads (S3), timeline generation, user following graph, likes/comments with MongoDB

15. How would you handle high concurrency during flash sales (e.g., Amazon Big Sale)?
Strategies: Queueing (Kafka, Redis), inventory locking, rate-limiting, atomic operations in MongoDB

üî¥ Expert-Level (Production-Grade + Distributed Edge)
Focus: Observability, failure recovery, resilience patterns

16. How would you implement a retry mechanism and dead-letter queue in your MERN backend?
Tools: BullMQ with Redis, backoff strategies, job retries

17. Design a distributed session manager with JWT and MongoDB
Address: token invalidation, multiple device login, IP/location tracking

18. How would you do multi-region deployment for a MERN app?
Talk about: Load balancer (GeoDNS), MongoDB Atlas global clusters, CDN (Cloudflare)

19. Explain CAP theorem in context of MongoDB
Where does MongoDB stand (CP or AP)? How do replica sets and sharding affect this?

20. How would you monitor and debug performance issues in your backend?
Tools: Express-status-monitor, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, APM (Datadog/New Relic)

üìò Tips to Crack Top System Design Interviews:
Use C4 model diagrams: Context, Containers, Components, Code

Practice tradeoff analysis: scalability vs simplicity, consistency vs availability

Use real metrics: ‚ÄúHandles 10M requests/day‚Äù, ‚ÄúLatency under 200ms‚Äù

Always cover: High-Level Design ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Data Flow ‚Üí Bottlenecks ‚Üí Scaling
