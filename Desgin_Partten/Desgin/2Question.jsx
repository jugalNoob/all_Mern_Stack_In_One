üß† Ultimate System Design Concepts for Senior-Level Interviews

‚úÖ Core Infrastructure

1. Client-Server Architecture

Concept: Separation of concerns ‚Äî Clients (UI) request; Servers (Backend) respond.

Interview Tip: Discuss trade-offs between monoliths and microservices.

Q: How would you handle 1M concurrent users?

A: Use WebSockets, Load Balancers, Connection Pooling.

2. IP Address & NAT

IPv4 vs IPv6: IPv4 (32-bit), IPv6 (128-bit).

NAT: Translates private IPs to public; used in home networks and cloud VPCs.

Cloud Gotcha: Private IP ranges in AWS (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

3. DNS

How it works: Root ‚Üí TLD ‚Üí Authoritative name server.

Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT.

Gotcha: DNS cache poisoning ‚Üí Use DNSSEC.

üåê Networking & Protocols

4. Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

Proxy: Client-side anonymity (e.g., Tor).

Reverse Proxy: Server-side (e.g., SSL termination, Load Balancing) ‚Äî NGINX.

5. HTTP/HTTPS, HTTP/2, HTTP/3

HTTPS: TLS handshake = Encrypted tunnel.

HTTP/2: Multiplexing over a single TCP connection.

HTTP/3: UDP-based QUIC protocol.

6. WebSockets

Use case: Real-time apps (e.g., chat, trading).

Scale challenge: Connection = open TCP socket = memory overhead.

7. gRPC

Efficiency: Binary protocol with Protocol Buffers.

Use case: Microservices, bi-directional streaming.

üóÉÔ∏è Databases & Storage

8. SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (PostgreSQL): ACID, joins, complex queries.

NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra): Horizontal scalability.

Q: When do you denormalize?

A: Read-heavy workloads.

9. Indexing

Types: B-Trees, Covering Indexes.

Cost: Slower writes due to index maintenance.

Q: When NOT to index? ‚Üí Low-cardinality columns.

10. Sharding

Range-based: IDs 1‚Äì100M on shard A.

Hash-based: Even distribution, less hot spotting.

11. Replication

Master-Slave (Read replicas), Multi-Master (conflict resolution needed).

12. OLTP vs OLAP

OLTP: Online Transaction Processing (e.g., Orders).

OLAP: Analytics (columnar databases like Snowflake).

13. Blob Storage

Cold vs Hot: Glacier (cheap, slow), Standard (fast).

Pattern: Store blobs in S3, metadata in DB.

üöÄ Performance & Scaling

14. Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

Vertical: Bigger machine (limited scale).

Horizontal: More servers (complex, scalable).

15. Load Balancers (L4 vs L7)

L4: TCP-level, faster.

L7: Application-aware (URL-based routing).

Sticky Sessions: Cookie-based or IP hashing.

16. Caching (Redis, Memcached)

Patterns: Cache-aside, Write-through.

Pitfall: Cache invalidation is hard.

17. CDN

What: Edge servers cache static files.

Providers: Cloudflare, Akamai.

Bonus: Edge compute with Lambda@Edge.

18. Rate Limiting

Algorithms: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket.

Tools: Redis + Lua, API Gateway plugins.

Headers: X-RateLimit-Remaining.

üì¶ Messaging & Communication

19. Message Queues (Kafka vs RabbitMQ)

Kafka: Partitioned logs, pub-sub.

RabbitMQ: Traditional queues, dead-letter queues.

20. Webhooks

Usage: Notify external systems of events (e.g., Stripe).

Challenge: Retry logic, security with secrets.

21. API Gateways

Features: Auth, rate limiting, routing.

Tools: Kong, Apigee.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Patterns

22. Microservices

Pro: Independent scaling/deployment.

Con: Latency, service discovery, data consistency.

23. Event-Driven Architecture

Concept: Emit ‚Üí Subscribe ‚Üí Process.

Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability.

24. CQRS + Event Sourcing

CQRS: Separate read/write models.

Event Sourcing: Persist state changes as events.

25. Saga Pattern

Usage: Long-running distributed transactions.

Patterns: Choreography (event-driven) or Orchestration (central controller).

26. Circuit Breakers

Tools: Hystrix, Resilience4J.

Prevents: Retry storms & cascading failures.

27. Idempotency

Concept: Same input ‚Üí same effect.

Use Case: Payment retries ‚Üí Use idempotency keys.

28. Distributed Locks

Redis: SETNX with expiry.

Zookeeper: Ephemeral nodes.

29. Service Discovery

Options: Consul, Eureka, DNS.

In K8s: Headless services.

30. Distributed Tracing

Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry.

Use Case: Track request across services.

üß™ Operational Excellence

31. Chaos Engineering

Netflix Chaos Monkey: Kill instances at random.

GameDay: Planned failure simulation.

32. Serverless

Function-as-a-Service: AWS Lambda.

Cold Starts: Latency on first call.

Use Case: Event-driven workloads.

33. Data Mesh

Concept: Decentralized data ownership.

Tech: Delta Lake, Databricks.

üß∞ Interview Tips

Clarify Requirements: Traffic, QPS, R/W ratio.

Estimate Scale: 10M DAU ‚âà 115 QPS avg, 10x for peak.

Draw Architecture: Client ‚Üí LB ‚Üí Services ‚Üí DB/Cache.

Discuss Trade-offs: Always explain pros/cons.

Prepare Deep Dives: "How would you shard user DB?"

Explain Failure Modes: "What if cache fails?"
