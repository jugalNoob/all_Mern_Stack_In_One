üéûÔ∏è What is Video Resolution?
‚úÖ Definition
Video resolution = the number of pixels displayed on the screen (width √ó height)


| Resolution Name | Pixel Dimensions | Total Pixels |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 480p (SD)       | 854 √ó 480        | \~410K       |
| 720p (HD)       | 1280 √ó 720       | \~920K       |
| 1080p (Full HD) | 1920 √ó 1080      | \~2M         |
| 2K              | 2048 √ó 1080      | \~2.2M       |
| 4K (UHD)        | 3840 √ó 2160      | \~8.3M       |
| 8K              | 7680 √ó 4320      | \~33M        |


More pixels = better clarity, but also higher memory usage, bigger file sizes, and slower buffering if internet is slow.

üîÅ How Resolution Works Internally
1. Raw Pixels & Frame Memory
Each frame of a video is made up of pixels. Each pixel typically uses 3 bytes (Red, Green, Blue = RGB).

So:

A 1080p frame = 1920 √ó 1080 √ó 3 bytes ‚âà 6.2 MB per frame

At 30 fps (frames per second), you need:

6.2 MB √ó 30 = ~186 MB per second uncompressed

This is huge ‚Äî that's why we use compression (e.g., H.264, AV1).

2. Compression (e.g., H.264, HEVC)
Compression reduces file size by:

Removing duplicate pixels across frames (temporal compression)

Using macroblocks (e.g., 16x16 chunks)

Using entropy encoding (smart math to reduce redundancy)

5 Megabits/sec = 0.625 MB/sec = 18.75 MB/minute (compressed!)
3. Video Streaming Workflow (e.g., YouTube)

[Video File] --> [Encoder] --> [Resolution Variants: 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p]
                            --> [CDN Server] --> [Player]
                                                  |
                                    +-------------+------------+
                                    |                          |
                                [Buffer]                [Resolution Picker]
CDN = Content Delivery Network stores copies globally

YouTube delivers video in chunks (HLS, DASH protocols)

Browser/player chooses best resolution based on:

Network speed

Buffer health

Device capability

üì¶ Buffer + Resolution
When you stream:

YouTube/Netflix downloads ~5-10 seconds worth of video (a buffer).

If you have fast internet, it may automatically upgrade to 1080p or 4K.

If the buffer empties (slow internet), player auto-downgrades resolution.

üîÅ Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)
This is the magic behind smooth video:

Monitors network speed & buffer size

Switches resolutions on the fly

üß† Memory Usage vs Resolution (RAM + GPU)


Component	Resolution Impact
RAM	Each frame is decoded to raw pixels in RAM
GPU VRAM	Higher resolution = more texture memory per frame
CPU	Decodes compressed video to raw pixels
Buffer RAM	Stores compressed chunks temporarily

üìä Memory Per Second (Uncompressed RGB)


| Resolution | MB per Frame | @30fps       |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 720p       | \~2.6 MB     | \~78 MB/sec  |
| 1080p      | \~6.2 MB     | \~186 MB/sec |
| 4K         | \~24.8 MB    | \~744 MB/sec |


üß™ JavaScript Example: Video Buffer Check
js
Copy
Edit
const video = document.querySelector('video');

setInterval(() => {
  const buffered = video.buffered;
  if (buffered.length > 0) {
    const bufferEnd = buffered.end(buffered.length - 1);
    const currentTime = video.currentTime;
    console.log('Buffered ahead:', (bufferEnd - currentTime).toFixed(2), 'seconds');
  }
}, 1000);

                            Resolution = Width √ó Height
High-resolution videos need more decoding time, higher bandwidth, and more GPU power.

| Era       | Standard    | Key Devices         |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1950s‚Äì70s | 480i        | Analog TVs (NTSC)   |
| 1980s‚Äì90s | 576i        | PAL/SECAM           |
| 2000s     | 720p, 1080p | DVDs, Blu-ray       |
| 2010s     | 4K          | UHD TVs, YouTube 4K |
| 2020s+    | 8K, HDR     | Gaming, Smart TVs   |


‚úÖ TL;DR: Key Concepts
Resolution = clarity (more pixels)

Buffer = stores video chunks to prevent stuttering

Compression = shrinks video size for streaming

ABR (Adaptive Bitrate) = auto resolution switching

Memory is heavily used:

RAM (buffered chunks)

VRAM (rendered frames)

CPU/GPU (decode & display)
