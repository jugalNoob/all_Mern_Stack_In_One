Nice one, Jugal! If you're diving into Node.js streams, you're stepping into one of the most powerful and underused areas of Node.js ‚Äî perfect for handling large data, real-time processing, and resource-efficient applications.

Here are some üî• Node.js stream-based project ideas ranked from beginner to advanced, with quick descriptions:

üå± Beginner Projects
1. File Splitter
What: Read a large file using a readable stream and split it into smaller chunks.

Concepts: fs.createReadStream, fs.createWriteStream, backpressure.

Bonus: Add CLI args for custom chunk sizes.

2. Log File Tailing Tool (Like tail -f)
What: Watch a growing log file and stream the newest lines to console.

Concepts: fs.watch, streaming reads.

Bonus: Add filters (e.g., only show lines with "ERROR").

3. HTTP Stream File Downloader
What: Stream a file from a URL and save it to disk without loading the entire file into memory.

Concepts: https.get(), piping to fs.createWriteStream.

üåø Intermediate Projects
4. Real-Time CSV to JSON Converter
What: Read a large CSV file and stream-convert it to JSON line-by-line.

Concepts: Transform streams, chunk parsing.

Bonus: Add a CLI tool or web interface.

5. Audio/Video Streamer
What: Serve audio/video files via HTTP with range requests and streams.

Concepts: fs.createReadStream, HTTP headers (Range, Content-Range).

Bonus: Create a simple web player using HTML5 video/audio.

6. Live Chat Server with Stream Logging
What: Socket-based chat app where all messages are streamed into a log file.

Concepts: Writable streams + sockets + logging.

üå≥ Advanced Projects
7. Live ETL Pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load)
What: Stream data from a source (e.g., Kafka, CSV, API), transform it (e.g., filter/map), and pipe to MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

Concepts: stream.Transform, stream chaining, backpressure handling.

Bonus: Add retry logic and monitoring dashboard.

8. Stream-Based Web Scraper
What: Stream data from webpages (e.g., RSS feeds), process in chunks, and store in a DB.

Concepts: Streaming HTTP responses, parsing HTML/XML line-by-line.

9. Live Compression Proxy Server
What: Create a reverse proxy that compresses incoming responses using GZIP or Brotli in real-time.

Concepts: zlib.createGzip(), http-proxy, streaming request/response handling.

10. Real-Time Log Dashboard (with WebSockets + Streams)
What: Watch a log file using streams and send updates to clients via WebSocket.

Concepts: fs.createReadStream, WebSocket, server-sent events, buffering.

Bonus: Add log level filtering and search.
