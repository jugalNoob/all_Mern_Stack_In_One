Perfect! I’ll prepare a Mega Socket.IO Q&A guide covering 50+ questions, from basic to advanced, including:

Core concepts (connections, events, rooms, namespaces)

Advanced topics (Redis adapter, BullMQ, Kafka, clustering, scaling)

Performance optimization (backpressure, volatile messages, rate-limiting)

Security & authentication

Real-world use cases (chat apps, dashboards, multi-tenant systems)

Here’s the structured plan I’ll follow for the PDF:
