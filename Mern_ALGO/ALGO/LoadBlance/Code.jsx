Here’s a categorized and concise explanation of all 16 Load Balancing and Networking Concepts you mentioned, including short demos, use cases, and notes where applicable:

✅ 1. Static Algorithms
Definition: Hardcoded server assignment. No dynamic decision-making.

Example: Always forward to Server A.

Use Case: Internal tools, testing environments.

🔁 2. Round Robin Algorithm
Definition: Each request is sent to the next server in a circular order.

Example: A → B → C → A → B → ...

Use Case: Uniform load distribution with equal server power.

💻 3. Round Robin Demo (JavaScript)
js
Copy
Edit
const servers = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
let index = 0;

function getNextServer() {
  const server = servers[index];
  index = (index + 1) % servers.length;
  return server;
}

console.log(getNextServer()); // A
console.log(getNextServer()); // B
console.log(getNextServer()); // C
console.log(getNextServer()); // A
⚖️ 4. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm
Definition: Servers are chosen in rotation but with weights.

Example: Server A (3), B (1) → A, A, A, B, A, A, A, B...

Use Case: Servers with different performance capacities.

📶 5. Dense (Dens) Round Robin
Definition: Variation of weighted round robin with denser scheduling.

Difference: Less frequent switches than Weighted Round Robin.

Use Case: Low latency systems with fewer context switches.

🌐 6. IP Hash Algorithm
Definition: Hash of client IP determines the server.

Use Case: Ensures client always hits same backend → session persistence.

js
Copy
Edit
const crypto = require('crypto');
const servers = ['A', 'B', 'C'];

function ipHash(ip) {
  const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(ip).digest('hex');
  const index = parseInt(hash, 16) % servers.length;
  return servers[index];
}

console.log(ipHash('192.168.0.1'));
🔗 7. URL Hash Algorithm
Definition: Hashing the URL path to decide the backend.

Use Case: Caching/static content delivery.

🎲 8. Random Allocation
Definition: A backend is selected at random.

Use Case: When average load is OK and no state needs to persist.

js
Copy
Edit
function getRandomServer() {
  return servers[Math.floor(Math.random() * servers.length)];
}
🔄 9. Dynamic Algorithms
Definition: Decisions are based on real-time metrics (CPU, latency).

Example: Use monitoring to pick least loaded server.

Use Case: Intelligent balancing under changing traffic.

📉 10. Least Connections
Definition: Route to server with the fewest active connections.

Use Case: Good for long-lived connections (e.g., WebSockets).

🏋️ 11. Weighted Least Connection
Definition: Like least connections, but considers server weight.

Use Case: Mixed-capacity servers.

⏱️ 12. Least Response Time Algorithm
Definition: Choose server with lowest average response latency.

Use Case: Real-time apps, APIs with critical timing.

🧠 13. Resource-Based Algorithms
Definition: Considers server resources like CPU, memory, disk.

Use Case: Systems with heterogeneous server specs.

Example: A server under CPU load gets skipped.

🌍 14. Geo-Location Based Load Balancing
Definition: Routes traffic to the nearest regional server.

Use Case: CDNs, global apps (Google, Cloudflare).

Example: Users in India → Mumbai server.

🚫 15. Rate Limiting
Definition: Restrict how many requests a client can make in a time window.

Use Case: Prevent abuse, DDoS protection.

Example: Max 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.

js
Copy
Edit
// Express.js + rate-limit
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
🧷 16. Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)
Definition: Route client to the same server across sessions.

Common Methods: IP hash, cookies, or session ID.

Use Case: Chat apps, shopping carts, login sessions.
