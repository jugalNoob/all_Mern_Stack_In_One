🧠 1. Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)
🔍 Use Case: Fuzzy Search / Autocorrect / Search Suggestions
Example: In a MERN search feature, use it to suggest:
User types “Googel” → Suggests “Google”.

🔄 2. Rate Limiting Algorithm – Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket
⚙️ Use Case: API Rate Limiting
Example: Prevent abuse in an Express API by only allowing 100 requests per minute per user.

Stripe, GitHub, and AWS use these models to throttle requests.

🧮 3. Count-Min Sketch
🔍 Use Case: Approximate Counting (Memory-efficient analytics)
Example: Track how many times a keyword is searched in a MERN app like a news site.
Can be used instead of MongoDB aggregation for real-time trending words.

⚖️ 4. Consistent Hashing
🧰 Use Case: Load Balancing, Caching, Distributed Microservices
Example: Route similar requests to the same backend in Node.js or distribute user sessions evenly among microservices in Express.

📶 5. HyperLogLog
📊 Use Case: Approximate Cardinality (Unique Count Estimation)
Example: Want to know how many unique users viewed your React app today, without storing every user ID.
HyperLogLog is used by Redis and Facebook.

🧭 6. A (A-Star) Pathfinding*
🚗 Use Case: Smart Navigation / Game Logic / Map Services
Example: A React-based delivery app that shows shortest delivery routes using A* over map coordinates.

🧩 7. Bloom Filters
✅ Use Case: Fast Existence Checks with Low Memory
Example: Check if a user is part of a banned list before hitting the database.
Used in email systems, browsers (e.g. Chrome's safe browsing), and Facebook.

🧬 8. Double Ratchet Algorithm (E2EE)
🔐 Use Case: End-to-End Encryption
Example: Secure messaging in a MERN chat app like WhatsApp or Signal uses Double Ratchet to change encryption keys on every message.

🧠 9. Reservoir Sampling
🏖️ Use Case: Random Sampling from Large Datasets
Example: Want to randomly show 10 reviews from a MongoDB collection of 1 million entries — without loading all into memory.

📚 10. Trie (Prefix Tree)
🔍 Use Case: Auto-complete / Predictive Text
Example: Type "lo" in React input → Suggests "login", "logout", "location".
Google search autocomplete uses Trie structure.

⏳ 11. Time Decay Algorithms (e.g. Exponential Decay)
📈 Use Case: Trending Content / Popularity Scoring
Example: Reddit and Hacker News use a time-decay algorithm to reduce score of old posts even if upvotes remain high.

🏃 12. Sliding Window
📏 Use Case: Real-Time Analytics / Throttling
Example: Check if a user has posted more than 3 comments in the last 10 seconds in a React chat app.

🤖 13. PageRank (Graph-based Ranking)
🔗 Use Case: Ranking Pages or Items
Example: A knowledge base built in MERN stack ranks articles based on their importance, like Google Search.

📍 14. GeoHashing
🌍 Use Case: Geo-location based clustering or search
Example: Food delivery MERN app clusters restaurants and matches delivery partners based on location.

🧾 15. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
🔍 Use Case: Diff Utilities, Suggestions, Typo Correction
Example: Version control UI (like GitHub) shows which lines were added/removed using LCS.

🛒 16. Apriori Algorithm / FP-Growth
🛍️ Use Case: Market Basket Analysis
Example: E-commerce MERN app shows "People who bought X also bought Y" using frequent itemset mining.

📦 17. K-way Merge
🗂️ Use Case: Merge Sorted Logs / Pagination across shards
Example: Merge chat logs from 5 different MongoDB shards in a chronological view.

🌡️ 18. Exponential Backoff
🔁 Use Case: Retry Mechanism for Failures
Example: Retry failed API requests in Node.js/React with increasing delays: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms...

🔐 19. MinHash
🧬 Use Case: Detect Similar Content
Example: Detect similar articles or duplicate uploads in MERN knowledge base using MinHash for fast similarity.
