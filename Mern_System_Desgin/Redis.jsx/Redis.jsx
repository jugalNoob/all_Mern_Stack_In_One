Exactly 👍 Redis plays a central role in system design when it comes to speed, caching, and real-time features. Let’s build a Redis-based system design overview (from basics to advanced).

🔹 Redis-Based System Design

Redis isn’t just a cache — it’s an in-memory data structure store used for caching, pub/sub, queues, sessions, and analytics.

1. Where Redis Fits in System Design

Caching Layer – Store frequently accessed data (user sessions, product catalog, API responses).

Message Broker – Redis Pub/Sub for real-time notifications or chat.

Queue System – With Redis Lists/Streams for task queues (e.g., background jobs).

Rate Limiting – Use Redis counters to limit API calls per user.

Session Store – Store user sessions for web apps.

Leaderboard/Ranking – Redis Sorted Sets for gaming leaderboards.

🔹 Example: Twitter can store trending hashtags in Redis for ultra-fast ranking.

2. Redis in System Architecture

Typical Redis-based design flow:

 Client (Browser/App)
        │
        ▼
   Load Balancer
        │
        ▼
   Application Servers
        │
 ┌──────┴─────────┐
 │                │
 ▼                ▼
Redis (Cache)   Database (SQL/NoSQL)


Reads: First check Redis. If not found → fetch from DB → update Redis.

Writes: Update DB → invalidate/update Redis.

👉 This pattern is known as Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading).

3. Redis Caching Strategies

Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Data is loaded into cache only when requested.

Write-Through: Write goes to cache and DB simultaneously.

Write-Behind: Write goes to cache first, DB updated later asynchronously.

🔹 Example: E-commerce site caches product details in Redis for fast reads.

4. Redis Data Structures & Use Cases

Strings: Key-value pairs (basic cache, counters).

Hashes: Store objects like user profiles.

Lists: Message queues, task lists.

Sets: Unique items (tags, followers).

Sorted Sets: Leaderboards, ranking systems.

Streams: Event logs, messaging.

🔹 Example: Instagram could use Redis Sorted Sets to rank trending posts.

5. Redis Pub/Sub for Real-Time Systems

Publisher → Redis Channel → Subscribers

Used for chat apps, notifications, live dashboards.

🔹 Example: Stock price updates in real-time dashboards.

6. Redis for Rate Limiting & Throttling

Use INCR with expiry to track requests per user.

Example: Allow 100 requests per minute per IP.

🔹 Example: Twitter API uses Redis counters to prevent abuse.

7. Scaling Redis

Replication: Master-slave for high availability.

Sharding: Split data across multiple Redis nodes.

Redis Cluster: Auto-sharding + replication.

Persistence:

RDB (snapshot) → point-in-time backups.

AOF (Append Only File) → every operation logged.

🔹 Example: Uber uses Redis clusters for global caching at scale.

8. Advantages of Redis in System Design

✅ Extremely fast (in-memory).
✅ Rich data structures.
✅ Great for real-time use cases.
✅ Supports persistence + clustering.

⚠️ Limitations:

Memory expensive (not great for cold storage).

Requires eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.).

Single-threaded core (but very optimized).

✅ If you master Redis + Caching strategies + Pub/Sub + Scaling, you can design systems like chat apps, leaderboards, analytics dashboards, and rate-limited APIs.
