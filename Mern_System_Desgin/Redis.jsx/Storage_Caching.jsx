ðŸ”¹ Storage & Caching Concepts (Extended)
13. Cache Eviction Techniques

When cache is full, eviction policies decide what to remove:

LRU (Least Recently Used): Evicts items not accessed for the longest time.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Browser cache removing old websites you havenâ€™t opened recently.

LFU (Least Frequently Used): Removes least-accessed items.
ðŸ”¹ Example: A video platform removes rarely watched videos from cache.

MRU (Most Recently Used): Evicts the most recently used item.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Used in databases where recent pages are less likely to be needed again.

FIFO (First In, First Out): Removes oldest cached item.
ðŸ”¹ Example: CDN caches evict old static assets first.

LIFO (Last In, First Out): Removes newest cached item.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Rare, but used in stack-like workloads.

RR (Random Replacement): Evicts randomly.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Embedded systems with low memory.

ðŸ‘‰ Real Example: Redis supports policies like LRU, LFU, and random replacement.

14. File-Based Storage System

Stores data in files and folders.

Works well for small projects but scales poorly for complex queries.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Blogs storing posts as .txt or .json files.
ðŸ”¹ OS Config: /etc/hosts in Linux.

15. Block Storage

Data stored in fixed-size blocks, managed by the OS.

Fast, efficient, used for databases and VMs.

ðŸ”¹ Example: AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) for EC2 instances.

16. Object Storage

Stores data as objects with metadata and unique IDs.

Scales massively and great for unstructured data (images, videos, logs).

ðŸ”¹ Example: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage.

17. In-Memory Databases

Stores data entirely in RAM for ultra-fast access.

Volatile (data lost if power goes off), but can be persisted with snapshots.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Redis and Memcached for caching, leaderboards, real-time analytics.

18. CDN Storage (Edge Caching)

CDNs store static content (JS, CSS, images, videos) close to users globally.

Reduces latency and offloads origin servers.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly caching static assets for Netflix or YouTube.

19. Hybrid Storage Systems

Combine multiple strategies (e.g., hot data in-memory, warm data in SSDs, cold data in object storage).

Optimizes cost and performance.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Facebook keeps recent posts in-memory (hot), older posts in MySQL (warm), and archives in cold storage (Hadoop/HDFS).
