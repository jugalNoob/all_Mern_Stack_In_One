🔹 What is Software Architecture?

Definition: Software architecture is the blueprint of a software system — it defines the structure, components, and how they interact.

It’s about high-level decisions: scalability, performance, fault tolerance, maintainability.

Example: Choosing microservices vs monolith, SQL vs NoSQL, event-driven vs request-response.

👉 Think of it as city planning (roads, zones, utilities).

🔹 Software Architecture Pattern vs Design Pattern

Architecture Pattern:

Large-scale solution style.

Defines system structure (components, communication, deployment).

Example: Microservices, Event-driven, Layered architecture.

Design Pattern:

Code-level, smaller scope.

Defines object-level reusable solutions.

Example: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy.

👉 Architecture = Building layout; Design = How each room is decorated.

🔹 Types of Software Architecture Patterns

I’ll explain 10 key ones + extra modern patterns, with examples and where to use.

1. Layered Architecture Pattern (n-tier)

Structure: Divided into layers (Presentation → Business → Persistence → Database).

Each layer communicates only with adjacent layers.

Example: Java Spring Boot MVC app, Express.js API with controllers, services, DAO.

Use Case: Business apps, ERP, web apps, REST APIs.

✅ Easy to maintain, ❌ Can be slow (layered overhead).

2. Client-Server Architecture Pattern

One central server serves multiple clients.

Example: Web browser (client) ↔ Web server (server).

Use Case: Websites, SaaS platforms.

✅ Centralized control, ❌ Single point of failure (unless HA added).

3. Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

Components communicate via events (publish/subscribe).

Loose coupling between producers & consumers.

Example: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, serverless (AWS Lambda triggers).

Use Case: Real-time apps, IoT, streaming, notifications.

✅ Highly scalable, ❌ Debugging flows can be hard.

4. Microkernel Architecture Pattern (Plug-in Architecture)

Core system + plug-in modules.

Example: VS Code (core editor + extensions), Eclipse IDE, browser with add-ons.

Use Case: Apps needing extensibility (customization, plugins).

✅ Flexibility, ❌ Core must be stable.

5. Microservices Architecture Pattern

Break system into independent services communicating over APIs (HTTP/gRPC).

Example: Netflix, Amazon, Uber backend.

Use Case: Large-scale distributed apps needing scalability & independent deployment.

✅ Independent scaling & deployment, ❌ Complex infra (service discovery, monitoring).

6. Space-Based Architecture Pattern (Cloud-ready)

Uses distributed caching + partitioning to handle high traffic.

Removes single DB bottleneck → spreads load across “spaces”.

Example: E-commerce flash sales, stock trading apps.

Use Case: Apps with high concurrent users and spikes.

✅ Handles scalability well, ❌ Harder to design/test.

7. Master-Slave Architecture Pattern

Master assigns work, slaves execute and report results.

Example: Database replication (MySQL master-slave), Hadoop MapReduce.

Use Case: Distributed processing, fault-tolerant DBs.

✅ Parallelism, ❌ Master bottleneck if overloaded.

8. Pipe-Filter Architecture Pattern

Data passes through sequential processing units (filters).

Example: Unix shell commands (cat | grep | sort), Compiler pipeline (lexical → syntax → semantic → codegen).

Use Case: Data processing pipelines, ETL.

✅ Good for batch jobs, ❌ Not great for interactive real-time apps.

9. Broker Architecture Pattern

Broker mediates between clients and components.

Example: Message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ), CORBA, JMS.

Use Case: Middleware, distributed apps.

✅ Decouples components, ❌ Broker becomes bottleneck.

10. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture Pattern

Each node is both a client and a server.

Example: BitTorrent, Blockchain, Skype (old).

Use Case: File sharing, decentralized networks.

✅ No central failure, ❌ Harder to secure & coordinate.

🔹 More Modern/Advanced Architecture Patterns

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Similar to microservices but with enterprise service bus (ESB).

Example: Banking systems, telecom.

Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

Core business logic (hexagon) + adapters for DB, API, UI.

Example: DDD apps.

Use Case: Testable, decoupled systems.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write models.

Example: Event-sourced systems, financial apps.

Event-Sourcing Architecture

Store events instead of final state.

Example: Banking (transactions instead of final balance).

Serverless Architecture

Functions deployed on cloud (FaaS).

Example: AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions.

Use Case: Small, event-driven apps.

Clean Architecture

Extension of layered/hexagonal → domain-centric, independent of frameworks.

Example: Enterprise backend apps.
