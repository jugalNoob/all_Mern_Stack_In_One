🔹 Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Example:
In a ride-hailing app like Uber, when a driver updates their location, an event is emitted (like locationUpdate). This event is consumed by services that update the driver’s availability and notify nearby passengers.

🔹 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Example:
In an e-commerce platform, the order management system uses CQRS to handle order placements (commands) separately from viewing order history (queries). This allows for high throughput in both creating and reading data.

🔹 Saga Pattern
Example:
In a travel booking system, booking a flight, hotel, and car rental are separate transactions. If the hotel booking fails after the flight is confirmed, the Saga pattern triggers a compensating transaction to cancel the flight, ensuring consistency.

🔹 Eventual Consistency
Example:
Social media apps use eventual consistency for likes and comments. When a user likes a post, the change may not immediately reflect across all user feeds but will eventually synchronize, ensuring that the system remains available.

🔹 Materialized View Pattern
Example:
In a dashboard application that displays real-time sales data, a materialized view stores precomputed metrics such as total sales and revenue, allowing for fast data retrieval without querying the main database repeatedly.

🔹 Transactional Outbox Pattern
Example:
In an order processing system, when a new order is created, the order details are stored in a database, and an "order created" message is placed in an outbox table. A separate service reads from the outbox to trigger order fulfillment, ensuring message reliability.

🔹 Sidecar Pattern
Example:
In a microservices architecture, a logging sidecar runs alongside each service, collecting logs and sending them to a centralized monitoring system, while the main service focuses on business logic.

🔹 Retry & Circuit Breaker Patterns
Example:
In a payment gateway integration, the system retries a failed payment transaction a few times before marking it as failed. The circuit breaker pattern kicks in if the failure rate is too high, temporarily halting retries to prevent system overload.

🔹 RPC and gRPC
Example:
In a microservice-based food delivery app, the restaurant service and the delivery service communicate via gRPC. When an order is prepared, the restaurant service calls the delivery service using gRPC to dispatch a delivery request, providing fast and efficient communication.

1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Project Idea: Real-Time Stock Market Dashboard

Why? Stock prices change frequently, and multiple services (alerting, analytics, UI) need to react instantly.

Implementation:

Producers: Market data feeds emit price update events.

Consumers: Alert service (e.g., "Stock X hit $Y"), analytics service (trends), UI (live charts).

2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Project Idea: E-Commerce Order System

Why? High write load (orders) and read load (order history) need separate scaling.

Implementation:

Command Side: Handle order creation (e.g., PlaceOrderCommand).

Query Side: Optimized read DB for order history (e.g., "Show my past orders").

3. Saga Pattern
Project Idea: Travel Booking Platform (Flights + Hotels)

Why? Bookings span multiple services; failures require rollbacks.

Implementation:

Saga steps: Book flight → Reserve hotel → Confirm payment.

If hotel fails, compensate by canceling the flight.

4. Eventual Consistency
Project Idea: Social Media "Like" System

Why? Likes don’t need immediate global visibility.

Implementation:

User likes a post → event emitted → async propagation to followers’ feeds.

5. Materialized View Pattern
Project Idea: Analytics Dashboard for Sales

Why? Aggregating data on-the-fly (e.g., "Total revenue") is slow.

Implementation:

Precompute sales totals hourly in a materialized view for fast dashboard loads.

6. Transactional Outbox Pattern
Project Idea: Order Processing with Notifications

Why? Ensure orders and notifications are atomic (no lost emails).

Implementation:

Orders table + outbox table (for "OrderConfirmed" emails).

A worker processes outbox entries to send emails.

7. Sidecar Pattern
Project Idea: Microservices with Centralized Logging

Why? Avoid mixing logging logic with business logic.

Implementation:

Each service has a sidecar container (e.g., Fluentd) that forwards logs to Elasticsearch.

8. Retry & Circuit Breaker Patterns
Project Idea: Payment Gateway Integration

Why? Payment APIs can fail transiently.

Implementation:

Retry 3 times on timeout.

Circuit breaker trips after 5 failures in a row.

9. RPC/gRPC
Project Idea: Food Delivery App (Restaurant ↔ Delivery Service)

Why? Low-latency communication between internal services.

Implementation:

Restaurant service calls DispatchDelivery(order) via gRPC.
