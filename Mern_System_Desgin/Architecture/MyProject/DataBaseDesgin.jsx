1. Sharding & Partitioning

Purpose: Distribute large datasets across nodes to improve throughput and storage capacity.

Horizontal Sharding: Split rows (users 1–1M → shard1, 1M+ → shard2)

Vertical Partitioning: Split columns (user profile vs login info)

Range Sharding: Data divided by ranges (dates, IDs)

Hash Sharding: Data hashed to assign nodes

Directory-Based Sharding: Mapping stored in a lookup table

Advanced Techniques:

Dynamic resharding (scale horizontally without downtime)

Geo-sharding (data close to user location)

2. Replication

Purpose: High availability, redundancy, disaster recovery.

Master-Slave: Single master, multiple read-only slaves

Master-Master / Multi-Master: Multiple writable nodes, requires conflict resolution

Synchronous Replication: Strong consistency, high latency

Asynchronous Replication: Eventual consistency, lower latency

Quorum-Based Replication: Writes/read must reach N nodes (Cassandra, DynamoDB)

3. Consistency Models

Purpose: Determine how data remains correct across distributed systems.

Strong Consistency: Every read sees latest write

Eventual Consistency: Updates propagate eventually

Causal Consistency: Operations in causal order

Read-Your-Writes Consistency: Client sees its own writes immediately

Linearizability & Serializability: Advanced DB transaction guarantees

4. Schema Design

Purpose: Optimized for query performance, storage, and maintainability.

Relational DB Design: Normalization (1NF → 3NF)

Denormalization: Precompute joins for high-read workloads

Wide Column / Column-Family: Cassandra, HBase (dynamic columns)

Time-Series Schema: Append-only, efficient for logs and metrics

Document-Oriented Schema: MongoDB collections (flexible JSON structure)

Graph Schema: Nodes & edges (Neo4j, social networks)

Advanced Tips:

Composite keys, indexing strategies, partition keys, foreign key trade-offs

5. Indexing & Query Optimization

Purpose: Reduce latency and improve throughput.

Index Types: B-Tree, Hash, GiST, GIN, Bitmap

Full-Text Indexing: Search engines

Materialized Views: Precomputed query results

Query Optimization: Analyze execution plans, use query hints

Sharded Queries: Route queries efficiently to correct shards

6. Caching Strategies

Purpose: Reduce database load and improve response times.

Cache Levels: Application, Redis/Memcached, CDN

Caching Strategies: Write-through, Write-back, Write-around

Eviction Policies: LRU, LFU, TTL

Distributed Cache: Consistent hashing, replication, invalidation

Advanced Use Cases:

Leaderboards, session storage, frequent analytics queries

7. Data Pipeline & Event Handling

Purpose: Process large-scale streams efficiently.

Event Streaming: Kafka, Pulsar for high-throughput messaging

ETL Pipelines: Extract, Transform, Load for data warehouses

Batch vs Stream Processing: Hadoop vs Spark Streaming vs Flink

CDC (Change Data Capture): Track DB changes for replication or analytics

8. Transactions & Concurrency Control

Purpose: Ensure correctness in multi-user environments.

ACID Transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Isolation Levels: Read Uncommitted → Serializable

Optimistic Concurrency Control: Check for conflicts at commit

Pessimistic Locking: Lock resources during transactions

Distributed Transactions: 2-Phase Commit, Saga Pattern

9. High Availability & Fault Tolerance

Purpose: Keep systems running under failure.

Multi-region replication

Automatic failover

Circuit breaker for services

Bulkhead isolation for microservices

Load balancers and health checks

10. Monitoring & Observability

Purpose: Detect and troubleshoot performance issues.

Query profiling and slow query logs

Metrics: latency, throughput, cache hit ratio

Distributed tracing: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry

Alerting & anomaly detection

Database dashboards: Grafana, Prometheus
