ðŸ”¹ 1. Basic Concepts (Foundation Layer)

These are the building blocks â€” you must understand them before moving forward.

Clientâ€“Server Model â€“ Clients (browsers, apps) send requests; servers respond with data.
ðŸ”¹ Example: When you open Facebook, your browser (client) requests data from Facebookâ€™s servers.

HTTP Basics â€“ Defines how clients & servers talk:

Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Headers: extra info (auth, cookies).

Status codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Error).
ðŸ”¹ Example: REST APIs use HTTP everywhere.

DNS (Domain Name System) â€“ Converts domain names to IP addresses.
ðŸ”¹ Example: google.com â†’ 142.250.190.14.

Latency vs Throughput â€“

Latency = speed of response.

Throughput = how many requests handled per second.
ðŸ”¹ Example: WhatsApp optimizes for low latency in messaging.

Scalability â€“ Ability to handle growth.

Vertical: add more CPU/RAM.

Horizontal: add more servers.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Instagram scales horizontally with load balancers.

Load Balancing â€“ Distribute requests across servers.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Amazon ELB balances millions of requests daily.

Caching â€“ Store frequently used data closer to users.

Browser cache

CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)

Server-side cache (Redis, Memcached).
ðŸ”¹ Example: Netflix CDN caches movies for faster streaming.

Database Basics â€“

SQL vs NoSQL

Indexing speeds up queries

Primary vs secondary indexes

Transactions ensure ACID consistency.
ðŸ”¹ Example: MySQL for transactions, MongoDB for flexible docs.
