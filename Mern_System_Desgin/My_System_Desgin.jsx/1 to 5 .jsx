1. Load Balancing

Definition: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.

Use Case: Handling high traffic on a website like YouTube or Amazon.

Types: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash.


Which Load Balancer is Best?

Small Websites / Blogs: Round Robin (simple & easy).

Mixed-Capacity Servers: Weighted Round Robin.

Real-Time Apps: Least Connections.

Session-Based Apps: IP Hash / Sticky Session.

High-Performance APIs: Least Response Time.

Global Apps: Geographic Load Balancer.


✅ Takeaway:

Real-time, stateful projects → Least Connections + Sticky Sessions

Stateless REST API projects → Round Robin / Weighted Round Robin / Least Response Time

You can even combine LBs: Use Least Connections for WebSocket servers and Round Robin for REST APIs in the same overall system.

| **IP Hash**                            | Chooses server based on a **hash of client’s IP**.                    | Shopping carts, session-based apps            | Ensures client always goes to same server           | Not flexible if server fails                                         | Session stickiness, maintaining user sessions              |
| **Random**                             | Sends requests **randomly** to servers.                               | Testing, simple setups                        | Easy to implement                                   | Uneven load distribution                                             | Small apps, test environments                              |
| **Least Response Time**                | Sends request to server responding **fastest** at the moment.         | High-performance APIs                         | Efficient, fast response                            | Requires constant monitoring                                         | APIs needing low latency                                   |
| **Weighted Least Connections**         | Combines weight + least connections                                   | Large, heterogeneous clusters                 | Efficient & smart load distribution                 | Complex                                                              | High-traffic websites with servers of different capacities |
| **Geographic / Global Load Balancing** | Directs traffic to **nearest data center**                            | Global services like Netflix                  | Reduces latency                                     | Needs global infrastructure                                          | Large-scale, global applications                           |

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**          | Requests are distributed **evenly in order**, one by one, to each server.                                 | Small web apps, simple websites. E.g., a blog with 3 servers: request 1 → server 1, request 2 → server 2, request 3 → server 3, then repeat. |
| **Least Connections**    | New requests go to the server with the **fewest active connections**.                                     | Real-time apps like chat apps or streaming services where some requests take longer.                                                         |
| **IP Hash**              | Server is chosen based on a **hash of the client’s IP**. Ensures the same client goes to the same server. | Shopping carts or session-based apps where user session data should stay on one server.                                                      |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Servers get traffic based on a **weight** (powerful servers get more requests).                           | Websites with servers of different capacities.                                                                                               |
| **Random**               | Requests are sent to servers **randomly**.                                                                | Simple load distribution, testing environments.                                                                                              |



Mapping Load Balancer Types to Horizontal Scaling

| **Load Balancer Type**       | **Horizontal Scaling Use**                   | **Notes**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**              | Stateless servers (web servers, API servers) | Simple distribution; works well when all servers have similar capacity                                         |
| **Weighted Round Robin**     | Mixed-capacity servers                       | Gives more traffic to powerful servers; common in horizontal scaling with heterogeneous servers                |
| **Least Connections**        | Real-time, long-request servers              | Ensures new requests go to the server with the fewest active connections                                       |
| **IP Hash / Sticky Session** | Session-based apps (stateful)                | Ensures a client always hits the same server; useful when horizontally scaling servers that store session data |
| **Least Response Time**      | High-performance APIs                        | Horizontal scaling with monitoring; directs traffic to the fastest available server                            |
| **Geographic Load Balancer** | Global apps with multiple regions            | Directs traffic to the nearest data center; horizontal scaling across regions                                  |


Traffic Management = Load Balancer

The traffic management system decides which car goes on which road, similar to a load balancer.

| **Load Balancer Type**   | **Road Analogy**                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Round Robin              | Cars go to roads in order: Road 1 → Road 2 → Road 3 → repeat     |
| Weighted Round Robin     | Bigger roads get more cars                                       |
| Least Connections        | Cars go to the road with the least traffic jam                   |
| IP Hash / Sticky Session | Same car always takes the same road (session stickiness)         |
| Least Response Time      | Cars go to the road with the fastest travel time                 |
| Geographic LB            | Cars go to the nearest highway/road to reach destination quickly |


Yes, Node.js cluster can work as Round Robin, especially for HTTP requests.



1. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

Definition:

Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server to make it more powerful.

Use Cases:

Small to medium workloads.

When you want simplicity (no need to change the app for multiple servers).

Pros:

Simple to implement.

No need to manage multiple servers.

Cons:

There’s a hardware limit—you can’t scale forever.

If the server fails, the whole system goes down.

Example:

Upgrading a server from 8GB → 32GB RAM and 4 CPUs → handles more requests.

A small e-commerce site adding more RAM to the database server.

2. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Definition:

Adding more servers to your system to share the load.

Use Cases:

High traffic apps, cloud-based apps, distributed systems.

Systems that need high availability and fault tolerance.

Pros:

Can scale almost infinitely by adding more servers.

Fault-tolerant: if one server fails, others handle the load.

Cons:

More complex to implement.

Requires load balancers, data partitioning, or replication.

Example:

Adding 3 more web servers behind a load balancer.

Netflix or YouTube adding servers in multiple regions to handle millions of users.





2. Caching ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Definition: Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage (like Redis or Memcached) 
to reduce database load and latency.

Use Case: Storing user session data or recent search queries.


1️⃣ Why Use Redis Cache

Databases (like MongoDB or MySQL) are slower than in-memory storage.

Frequently accessed data can be stored in Redis, which is in-memory → super fast.

Reduces database load, improves response time, and makes the system more scalable.



| Feature        | Benefit                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast access    | Redis is in-memory → milliseconds response                 |
| Reduce DB load | Frequently accessed data doesn’t hit DB every time         |
| Scalability    | Supports high traffic for popular queries                  |
| Example        | Latest Bitcoin price, recent search queries, user sessions |






3. Database Sharding

Definition: Splitting a large database into smaller, faster, more manageable pieces (shards).

Use Case: Scaling social media feeds across multiple database servers.




4. Replication

Definition: Copying data across multiple servers to ensure reliability and availability.

Use Case: Master-Slave replication in MySQL for read scalability.



5. CAP Theorem


If you want, I can make a diagram showing MongoDB replica set + CAP trade-offs in your Bitcoin
 live chat project, so it’s very visual and easy to explain in interviews.


Definition: A distributed system can have only two out of three: Consistency,
 Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

Use Case: Deciding trade-offs in NoSQL databases like Cassandra or MongoDB.



Here’s a clear explanation of how CAP Theorem applies to MongoDB in your project:

1️⃣ CAP Theorem Recap

| Component                   | Meaning                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Consistency (C)**         | Every read receives the most recent write.                               |
| **Availability (A)**        | Every request receives a response (success/failure).                     |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | The system continues working even if network splits occur between nodes. |



CAP Theorem: A distributed system can guarantee only two of these three at the same time.

2️⃣ How It Works in MongoDB

MongoDB is a distributed NoSQL database. Depending on your setup:

Replica Set (for high availability)

Nodes: 1 primary + multiple secondaries

Writes go to primary, reads can go to primary or secondary

Guarantees: Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP) by default, if you read from primary

Trade-off: If a network partition occurs, some nodes may become unavailable to maintain consistency

Sharded Cluster (for scalability)

Data split across multiple shards

Provides Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP)

Trade-off: Sometimes reads may be eventually consistent (slightly stale)

3️⃣ Example in Bitcoin Live Chat Project

Scenario: Storing live Bitcoin prices or chat messages

Consistency Focus (C):

Every client sees the exact same latest price or chat message

Use primary reads in a replica set

During network issues, some nodes may be unavailable temporarily

Availability Focus (A):

Every client gets some response immediately, even if slightly stale data

Use secondary reads or relaxed write concerns

Ensures system is always up, but data may not be fully consistent

Summary Table:

Requirement	MongoDB Setup	Behavior
Strong Consistency	Primary reads	Latest price/chat guaranteed
High Availability	Secondary reads / relaxed writes	Some clients may see slightly stale data
Partition Tolerance	Replica set / sharded cluster	System continues working even if some nodes are down
Key Takeaway for Your Project

For live Bitcoin price updates, you might favor Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP), so the app is always responsive, even if a few nodes are down.

For critical actions (like financial transactions or chat logs), you might favor Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP) to ensure no data is lost or inconsistent.
