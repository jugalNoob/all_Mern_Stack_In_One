ðŸ”¹ 3. Advanced Concepts

This is where big tech systems live.

Microservices Architecture â€“ Breaking monoliths into small services.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Amazon runs separate microservices for product, cart, and payment.

Event-Driven Architecture â€“ Async communication with events.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Uber streams driver location updates via Kafka.

Database Scaling â€“
3.1 Multi-leader replication
3.2 Distributed databases (CockroachDB, Spanner, Cassandra).
ðŸ”¹ Example: Google Spanner supports Gmailâ€™s global scale.

Distributed Consensus â€“ Raft, Paxos ensure agreement in clusters.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Zookeeper for leader election in Kafka.

Caching Strategies â€“ Write-through, write-behind, invalidation.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Reddit uses Redis for hot posts.

CQRS â€“ Separate read/write models for performance.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Banking apps split transfers (writes) from balance checks (reads).

Event Sourcing â€“ Store events, not just state.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Audit logs & finance systems.

Real-Time Data Processing â€“ Stream processing with Kafka, Flink.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Netflix real-time recommendations.

Search Systems â€“ Fast full-text search with Elasticsearch, Solr.
ðŸ”¹ Example: LinkedIn job search.

Containerization & Orchestration â€“ Docker & Kubernetes manage services.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Spotify microservices run on Kubernetes.

High Availability & Fault Tolerance â€“ Circuit breakers, retries, failover.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Netflix Chaos Monkey tests resilience.

Rate Limiting & Throttling â€“ Protect APIs from abuse.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Twitter API enforces per-minute limits.

Data Lakes & Warehousing â€“ Store raw & analytical data.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Airbnb uses Snowflake + data lake for analytics.

Edge Computing â€“ Run compute closer to users.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Cloudflare Workers reduce latency.
