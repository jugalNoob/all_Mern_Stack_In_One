Here’s a complete guide to Nginx, covering all major topics, including what it is, why it's used, and practical use cases. This is especially useful if you're using Nginx with Node.js, Express, REST APIs, or microservices.

🚀 What is Nginx?
Nginx (pronounced “engine-x”) is a high-performance web server that also functions as:

Reverse proxy

Load balancer

HTTP cache

API gateway (to some extent)



| Feature                      | Reason to Use                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Reverse Proxy             | Hide backend servers, distribute traffic, SSL offload |
| ⚖️ Load Balancer             | Distribute load across multiple backend servers       |
| 🔐 TLS/SSL Termination       | Manage HTTPS at the proxy layer                       |
| 🚀 Fast Static File Serving  | Serve HTML/CSS/JS/images directly                     |
| 📦 Compression (gzip)        | Reduce bandwidth and speed up loading                 |
| 🛡️ Security & Rate Limiting | Protect backend APIs from abuse                       |
| 🔧 Configurability           | Highly flexible with easy-to-read config files        |
| 📈 Monitoring & Logs         | Access logs, error logs for debugging                 |
| 🗂️ Virtual Hosts            | Host multiple domains or apps from one server         |



📚 All Topics You Should Learn in Nginx
1. 🔧 Basic Configuration
nginx.conf structure

http, server, location blocks

Starting, stopping, and reloading Nginx



2. 🔁 Reverse Proxy
Forward requests to backend (Node.js, Django, etc.)

Example:

nginx
Copy
Edit



3. ⚖️ Load Balancing
Round-robin, IP-hash, Least Connections

Load balance between multiple servers

nginx
Copy
Edit



4. 🔐 SSL/TLS Termination
Install SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt or manual)

Redirect HTTP to HTTPS



5. 📂 Serving Static Files
Serve files from /var/www/html or React/Angular build folders.



6. ⛔ Error Handling
Custom 404, 500 pages




7. 🔄 Caching
Static file cache

FastCGI cache (for PHP apps)

Proxy cache (for API responses)




8. 📉 Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
Throttle abusive clients



9. 🔐 Basic Auth & Access Control
Block IPs, allow only internal access

HTTP Basic Authentication



10. 🌍 Virtual Hosts / Server Blocks
Host multiple sites/domains



11. 📊 Logging
Access and error logs

Customize log format





12. 🚥 Rewrite & Redirect Rules
Permanent or temporary redirects

nginx
Copy
Edit
rewrite ^/old$ /new permanent;


13. 📦 Gzip Compression
Compress responses to save bandwidth


gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain application/json;



14. 🔐 Security Hardening
Hide server version

Limit file types, disable .php on public

Use security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)

15. 📡 WebSockets Support

Required for Socket.IO or real-time apps


proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";


16. 🧩 Modular Architecture
Use modules like ngx_http_stub_status_module for metrics

Compile custom modules if needed

17. 📁 Include External Configs

Modular configs

include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;



🛠️ Where to Use Nginx in Projects?  




| Project Type            | Use of Nginx                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| React/Vue App + API     | Serve frontend, proxy to `/api` backend |
| MERN Stack App          | Reverse proxy to Express server         |
| Microservices           | Load balancing & API gateway            |
| REST APIs               | Caching, rate limiting, HTTPS           |
| Internal Dashboards     | Secure behind IP allowlist or VPN       |
| IoT or Realtime Systems | WebSocket proxy and rate control        |
| Multiple Domains        | Virtual hosts with different SSL certs  |



📦 Nginx Alternatives (When to Use) 


| Alternative | Use Case                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apache**  | When using .htaccess or legacy PHP/WordPress       |
| **Traefik** | Auto-routing in Docker/Kubernetes environments     |
| **HAProxy** | High-performance TCP/UDP load balancing            |
| **Envoy**   | Service mesh, gRPC proxy, observability (advanced) |
