Node.js Official Documentation Structure (v24.5.0) Overview
Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the Node.js documentation structure with key details about each module:

Core Modules
1. Assertion Testing
Provides a simple assertion testing library

Used for writing tests (though Test Runner is now preferred)

assert.strictEqual(), assert.deepStrictEqual(), etc.

2. Asynchronous Context Tracking
API for tracking asynchronous context across callbacks

Useful for request tracing and diagnostics

3. Async Hooks
Track lifetime of asynchronous resources

Enables creating async context propagation

4. Buffer
Handle binary data directly

Critical for working with streams, file systems, and network protocols

5. Child Processes
Spawn child processes (spawn(), exec(), fork())

Communicate between Node.js and system commands/other languages

6. Cluster
Create child processes that share server ports

Enables scaling across CPU cores

7. Console
Terminal output similar to browser console

console.log(), console.error(), console.table(), etc.

Networking
8. HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2
Full-featured HTTP server and client implementations

HTTPS for TLS/SSL encrypted connections

HTTP/2 for modern protocol features

9. Net
Low-level TCP and UNIX socket networking

Basis for HTTP module

10. DNS
Domain name system lookups

Both promise-based and callback interfaces

11. UDP/Datagram
Connectionless networking via dgram module

File System & Data
12. File System (fs)
File operations (read/write/delete)

Both synchronous and promise-based APIs

File watching capabilities

13. Path
Cross-platform path manipulation

path.join(), path.resolve(), etc.

14. Stream
Handle streaming data efficiently

Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams

15. Zlib
Compression/decompression (gzip, deflate, etc.)

Works with streams and buffers

Security
16. Crypto
Cryptographic functions (hashes, HMAC, ciphers)

Supports OpenSSL's hash and cipher algorithms

17. TLS/SSL
Secure sockets layer implementation

Used by HTTPS module

18. Web Crypto API
Standardized cryptographic operations

Browser-compatible API

19. Permissions
Experimental module for process permissions

Restrict filesystem, child process, and worker access

JavaScript Language Features
20. Modules
CommonJS and ES Module systems

require() vs. import/export

Package management details

21. Events
Event emitter pattern

Core to Node.js architecture

22. Util
Utility functions (promisify, inherits, etc.)

Formatting and inspection helpers

23. Query Strings
Parse and format URL query strings

24. URL
URL parsing and resolution (WHATWG URL standard)

Performance & Diagnostics
25. Performance Hooks
Measure performance of Node.js applications

User timing API similar to browsers

26. Diagnostics Channel
Publish/subscribe API for diagnostic data

27. Trace Events
Collect and report tracing data

Compatible with Chrome's trace event format

28. Inspector
Interface for debugging with Chrome DevTools

--inspect flag functionality

System Interaction
29. OS
Operating system utilities

CPU, memory, network interfaces, etc.

30. Process
Information and control for current process

Environment variables, signals, exiting

31. Worker Threads
Run JavaScript in parallel threads

Share memory via ArrayBuffer/SharedArrayBuffer

Development Tools
32. Debugger
Built-in debugging client

Command-line debugger interface

33. Test Runner
Built-in test runner (node:test)

Alternative to external libraries like Mocha

34. REPL
Read-Eval-Print-Loop interactive shell

Useful for experimentation

35. Report
Generate diagnostic reports

Helpful for troubleshooting production issues

Specialized APIs
36. WASI
WebAssembly System Interface

Run WASM with system access

37. VM
Run JavaScript code in isolated contexts

Similar to eval() but with more control

38. Domain (Deprecated)
Error handling across async operations

Legacy module being phased out

39. Single Executable Applications
Package Node.js apps into single executables

Experimental feature

40. SQLite
Built-in SQLite3 database support

Experimental module in Node.js 21+

Compatibility & Extensibility
41. C++ Addons
Create native addons with C/C++

Both N-API and legacy approaches

42. V8
Interface to V8 JavaScript engine

Access engine-specific features

43. Web Streams API
Standardized web streams implementation

Browser-compatible streaming interface

Deprecated/Historical
44. Punycode (Deprecated)
RFC 3492 encoding/decoding

Legacy URL encoding system

45. String Decoder
Decode buffer objects into strings

Primarily for legacy code
