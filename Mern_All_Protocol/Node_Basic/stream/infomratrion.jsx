1. What are Streams?
Streams in Node.js process data chunk by chunk instead of reading the whole thing into memory at once.
This is perfect for:

Large files

Video streaming

Real-time data



1. Reading and Writing Large Files
Instead of using fs.readFile() (loads whole file into memory), streams let you process chunks of a file at a time.

Example:

Reading a 2 GB log file without crashing your app.

Writing an uploaded file to disk as itâ€™s being received.

2. Video/Audio Streaming
Streams let you serve media content in parts (like YouTube buffering).

This works with HTTP Range requests, sending chunks so the user can start watching without downloading the full file.

3. Network Data (HTTP Requests/Responses)
In Node.js, every HTTP request and response is a stream.

Example:

Downloading a large file from a remote server and piping it directly to a file without waiting for the whole download.

4. Real-Time Data Processing
When data comes continuously:

Chat messages

IoT sensor readings

Stock market data

Streams let you process the data as soon as it arrives.

5. Data Transformation (Pipes)
You can transform data on the fly without saving it first.

Example:

Compressing (zlib) or encrypting (crypto) a file while reading it.

ðŸ’¡ Key Advantages of Streams

Lower memory usage (only store small chunks in memory at any time)

Faster start time (you can start processing before the entire data is available)

Better for large or continuous data sources
