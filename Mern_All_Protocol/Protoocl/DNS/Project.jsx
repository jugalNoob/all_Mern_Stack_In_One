üß† Which Protocol Does DNS Use: UDP or TCP?
‚úÖ DNS primarily uses UDP for speed.


| Use Case                       | Protocol       | Reason                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Standard DNS queries (A, AAAA) | **UDP**        | Fast, low overhead            |
| Large responses (>512 bytes)   | **TCP**        | UDP can't carry large packets |
| Zone transfers between servers | **TCP**        | Reliable, full data delivery  |
| DNSSEC                         | **TCP**        | More secure, larger payload   |
| DNS over TLS (DoT)             | **TCP**        | Secure via encryption         |
| DNS over HTTPS (DoH)           | **TCP** / HTTP | Encrypted DNS for browsers    |
| HTTP/3 DNS (DoH over QUIC)     | **UDP (QUIC)** | Most modern secure DNS        |


‚úÖ Summary:


| Protocol     | DNS Use Case                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **UDP**      | Normal client queries             |
| **TCP**      | Fallback for large or secure data |
| **TCP+TLS**  | DNS over TLS (DoT)                |
| **UDP+QUIC** | DNS over HTTP/3 (DoH/3)           |



üß™ For Your Node.js DNS Project


| Project Type                    | Recommended Protocol |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Simple Custom DNS Server**    | ‚úÖ **UDP** (`dgram`)  |
| **DNS-over-TCP resolver**       | ‚úÖ TCP (`net`)        |
| **Secure DoH (DNS over HTTPS)** | ‚úÖ TCP (with `https`) |
| **DoH over HTTP/3**             | ‚ö° QUIC over UDP      |


üß∞ Project Ideas by Protocol


| Project Idea                               | Protocol   | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| ‚úÖ Basic DNS server (like we did)           | UDP        | Easy       |
| üîí DoH proxy server (Cloudflare DoH)       | TCP        | Medium     |
| üß† DNS over TLS (DoT) resolver             | TCP/TLS    | Medium     |
| üåê DNS server that supports both UDP & TCP | UDP + TCP  | Medium+    |
| ‚ö° Build DNS server over QUIC (DoH/3)       | UDP (QUIC) | Advanced   |




‚úÖ Best for Your First Project?
For now, go with:

üéØ UDP-based DNS server using dgram in Node.js

Then later:

üîê Upgrade it with a TCP fallback using net.createServer()
üîê Add DoH support using axios or https module

Want This?
Would you like me to help you:

Build a dual UDP + TCP DNS server in Node.js?

Add DoH (DNS over HTTPS) features?

Create a step-by-step DNS project roadmap?

Let me know how far you'd like to take this!
