üöÄ What is QUIC?
QUIC is a transport-layer network protocol developed by Google and later adopted by the IETF. It is the foundation for HTTP/3, replacing TCP underneath.

‚úÖ QUIC = UDP + TLS 1.3 + Multiplexing + Reliability + Low Latency

üß© QUIC = All-in-One Solution


| Feature        | QUIC ‚úÖ                    | TCP + TLS (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2) ‚ùå              |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Multiplexing   | ‚úÖ Native                  | ‚úÖ in HTTP/2 but head-of-line blocking below |
| Reliability    | ‚úÖ Built-in                | ‚úÖ                                           |
| TLS Encryption | ‚úÖ Always (TLS 1.3)        | ‚úÖ but negotiates separately                 |
| Fast Handshake | ‚úÖ 0-RTT & 1-RTT           | ‚ùå Multi-step TLS handshake                  |
| Connection ID  | ‚úÖ Resumes after IP change | ‚ùå Disconnects on IP change                  |
| Built on UDP   | ‚úÖ Yes                     | ‚ùå TCP-based                                 |



üì¶ How QUIC Works Internally
Works over UDP (port 443) instead of TCP

Uses TLS 1.3 for encryption (always encrypted)

Has streams (independent logical connections over one UDP connection)

Supports connection migration (IP changes don‚Äôt break it)

Enables 0-RTT handshake (reuse previous connection for near-instant data start)

‚ö° Why QUIC Is So Fast



| Feature                | Impact                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ No TCP handshake     | Reduces latency (no SYN ‚Üí ACK wait)  |
| ‚úÖ 0-RTT TLS            | Client can send data on first packet |
| ‚úÖ Multiplexed streams  | No head-of-line blocking like TCP    |
| ‚úÖ Stateless retry      | Prevents spoofing with minimal delay |
| ‚úÖ Connection migration | Resumes session even if IP changes   |



üîí QUIC = Secure by Default
Always uses TLS 1.3

Cannot be downgraded

Resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks

No plaintext handshake or data ever transmitted

üß† QUIC vs HTTP/2


| Feature            | HTTP/2 over TCP      | HTTP/3 over QUIC    |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Transport Layer    | TCP                  | QUIC (UDP)          |
| TLS                | Separate TLS 1.2/1.3 | Built-in TLS 1.3    |
| Head-of-Line Block | Still occurs at TCP  | Eliminated          |
| Connection Resume  | No                   | Yes (IP changes OK) |
| Mobile Performance | Mediocre             | Excellent           |

üí° QUIC in Node.js
QUIC is not fully supported in Node.js stable, but you can explore:

QUIC client/server using quiche or ngtcp2 (C/C++)

Use HTTP/3 support in Cloudflare Workers, NGINX, or BoringSSL-based proxies

If you really want to play with QUIC in Node.js:


node --experimental-quic myquicserver.js
