Yes, Jugal — you can make a QUIC project in Node.js, but Node.js does not natively support QUIC or HTTP/3 in stable releases. The QUIC implementation was experimental and has since been removed from Node core.

But don't worry — you still have 3 working options to build a QUIC-based (HTTP/3) project using Node.js:

✅ Option 1: Use Node.js with NGINX (HTTP/3 over QUIC)
You run your app in Node.js (Express, Fastify, etc.), and let NGINX or Caddy handle the QUIC/HTTP/3 layer.

🔹 Architecture
java
Copy
Edit
Browser ⇄ QUIC/HTTP3 ⇄ NGINX ⇄ HTTP ⇄ Node.js App (Express/Fastify)
✅ Benefits:
Full QUIC support via NGINX

Node.js stays unchanged

HTTP/3 works in browsers (Chrome, Firefox)

📦 Steps:
Deploy Node.js backend normally (on port 3000 or 9000)

Use NGINX with listen 443 quic; and http3 on; config

NGINX handles QUIC over UDP and proxies to Node.js

🧪 Example: QUIC with NGINX and Node.js
NGINX Config:

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen 443 quic reuseport;  # QUIC enabled
  ssl_certificate     cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key key.pem;
  http3 on;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Node.js app
  }
}
Node.js App (server.js):

js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello from Node.js behind QUIC (NGINX)!'));
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Node app on http://localhost:3000'));
✅ Option 2: Use Cloudflare Tunnel + Node.js
Use Cloudflare’s free HTTP/3 reverse proxy to expose your Node.js app securely using QUIC.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
This gives you:

Free HTTPS over QUIC (HTTP/3)

No NGINX or certs needed

Browser supports HTTP/3 out-of-box

🚫 Option 3: Native QUIC in Node.js (Removed)
Node once supported QUIC via:

bash
Copy
Edit
node --experimental-quic server.js
But this feature was:

Removed from Node.js 16+

Incomplete and unmaintained

Not recommended for production use

🔗 QUIC removal PR

✅ Best Practice in 2025
Use:

Node.js (Express, Fastify, etc.)

Behind a QUIC-compatible reverse proxy like:

🔹 NGINX (with quiche compiled)

🔹 Cloudflare proxy

🔹 Caddy (simple HTTP/3 server)

| Method                 | QUIC Support | Node.js Changes Needed | Production Ready |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Node + NGINX           | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes            |
| Node + Cloudflare      | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes            |
| Native QUIC in Node.js | ❌ Removed    | ⚠️ Experimental Only   | ❌ No             |
