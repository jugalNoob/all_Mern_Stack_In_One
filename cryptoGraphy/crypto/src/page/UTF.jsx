// :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::   UTF-8  UTF-16  UTF-32


// UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are different encoding formats used to represent Unicode characters in computer systems. They vary in terms of how many bytes they use to encode each character and how they handle different character sets. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each:

// 1. UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
// Encoding: Uses 1 to 4 bytes per character.
// How it works:
// For characters in the ASCII range (0‚Äì127), UTF-8 uses 1 byte (the same as ASCII).
// For other characters, it uses 2, 3, or 4 bytes depending on the complexity of the character.
// Advantages:
// Efficient for Western languages (uses less space for ASCII characters).
// Backward compatible with ASCII.
// Widely used in the web and popular for file formats (like HTML, JSON, etc.).
// Common Use: Websites, text files, and applications where storage space is a concern.
// Example Encoding:
The character "A" (ASCII) = 0x41 (1 byte)
The character "‚Ç¨" (Euro sign) = 0xE2 0x82 0xAC (3 bytes)


// 2. UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
// Encoding: Uses either 2 or 4 bytes per character.
// How it works:
// Most characters are encoded in 2 bytes (16 bits).
// Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) use 4 bytes (called "surrogate pairs").
// Advantages:
// More efficient for Asian languages (like Chinese, Japanese) that use more non-ASCII characters.
// Disadvantages:
// Less efficient for text dominated by ASCII characters (like English).
// Handling surrogate pairs adds complexity.
// Common Use: Internal text processing for systems like Windows or Java, and file formats like Microsoft Office.
// Example Encoding:
The character "A" = 0x0041 (2 bytes)
The character "êçà" (Gothic letter) = 0xD800 0xDF48 (4 bytes)



// 3. UTF-32 (32-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
// Encoding: Uses 4 bytes (32 bits) for every character.
// How it works:
// Every character, regardless of its Unicode code point, is represented with 4 bytes.
// Advantages:
// Very simple because every character is exactly 4 bytes, making it easy to index characters.
// Disadvantages:
// Memory inefficient for most texts, especially those that primarily use ASCII characters.
// Common Use: Rarely used due to its inefficiency, but sometimes found in systems where fixed-width encoding is required.
// Example Encoding:
The character "A" = 0x00000041 (4 bytes)
The character "êçà" = 0x00010348 (4 bytes)


Summary of Differences:::::----------------------<><><><><><><><><><><><>
UTF-8: Variable-width (1‚Äì4 bytes), efficient for ASCII-heavy text, widely used on the web.
UTF-16: Variable-width (2‚Äì4 bytes), efficient for non-ASCII characters like those in Asian scripts, common in internal processing.
UTF-32: Fixed-width (4 bytes), simple but memory inefficient.
