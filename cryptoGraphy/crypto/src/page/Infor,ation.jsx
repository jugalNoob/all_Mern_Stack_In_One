:::::::::::::::: ALL hash name and Use case ...............................>>>>


1. MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):
Description: A widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
Use Case: Commonly used for verifying data integrity, but considered insecure for modern password storage due to vulnerability to hash collisions.


2. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):
Description: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash, often referred to as SHA-128 because of its internal structure.
Use Case: Used for digital signatures and certificates, but also considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for collisions.


3. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2):
SHA-256: Produces a 256-bit hash value. It’s part of the SHA-2 family and offers stronger security compared to SHA-1.
Use Case: Commonly used in blockchain technologies (e.g., Bitcoin), SSL certificates, and secure password hashing.


4. SHA-512:
Description: Produces a 512-bit hash, part of the SHA-2 family.
Use Case: Suitable for high-security applications where a longer hash output provides more protection against brute force attacks.


5. MySQL:
Description: A widely used relational database management system (RDBMS).
Use Case: Supports hashing functions such as MD5 and SHA1 for storing hashed passwords, though these methods are generally deprecated for security reasons. Modern MySQL versions recommend using more secure hashing methods.


6. MD5 in WordPress:
Description: WordPress used MD5 for password hashing in earlier versions.
Use Case: As WordPress has evolved, it now uses bcrypt for stronger password security.


7. MD5 in phpBB:
Description: phpBB (a popular forum software) used MD5 for password hashing, which has since been updated in newer versions due to the algorithm’s security weaknesses.
Use Case: Like WordPress, phpBB transitioned to stronger hashing algorithms such as bcrypt.


8. Bcrypt:
Description: A key derivation function designed for secure password hashing. Bcrypt incorporates a salt and is adaptive, meaning it can increase the number of iterations to remain resistant to brute-force attacks.
Use Case: Widely used in modern applications for securely hashing passwords (e.g., web applications, operating systems).


9. MD5-Crypt:
Description: A password hashing algorithm based on MD5, with added salting and iteration to strengthen the security.
Use Case: Used in Unix systems for password storage, but still less secure compared to newer algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.


10. Oracle (Oracle RDBMS):
Description: A popular enterprise-grade database system that supports various cryptographic hashing methods for password storage.
Use Case: Oracle provides several hash functions like SHA-1 and SHA-2 for securing passwords.


11. SHA-Crypt:
Description: A password hashing method that uses the SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions.
Use Case: Considered secure for password storage and widely used in Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux systems use SHA-512 by default).


12. PHPS (PHP Hashing):
Description: Refers to PHP’s built-in password hashing functions, such as password_hash(), which uses bcrypt by default.
Use Case: PHP’s secure password hashing is essential for web development, ensuring strong protection against brute-force attacks by using salting and automatic algorithm selection.



Argon2:

Description: A memory-hard, key derivation function and the winner of the Password Hashing Competition (PHC).
Use Case: One of the most secure algorithms for password hashing, providing defense against GPU attacks and offering configurations for memory and time costs.


PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2):
Description: A key derivation function that applies a pseudorandom function (like HMAC) with multiple iterations to secure passwords.
Use Case: Widely used in password storage (e.g., WPA2 WiFi encryption, certain web applications).



Scrypt:
Description: A memory-intensive key derivation function.
Use Case: Used for password hashing and cryptocurrency mining, designed to require a large amount of memory to resist brute-force attacks on specialized hardware.


Whirlpool:
Description: A cryptographic hash function producing a 512-bit hash.
Use Case: Used in some digital signature systems and password hashing scenarios where a strong hash function is needed.

Blake2:
Description: A high-performance cryptographic hash function, considered faster than SHA-2.
Use Case: Used in secure applications like file integrity checks and cryptographic applications.


CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check):
Description: Not a cryptographic hash but an error-detecting code commonly used in network communications and file integrity checks.
Use Case: Ensures data integrity during transmission and storage, but is not secure for cryptographic purposes
