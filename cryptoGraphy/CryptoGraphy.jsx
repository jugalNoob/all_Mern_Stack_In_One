"Bit" is a basic unit of information in computing, representing a binary digit, either 0 or 1. Here’s a quick breakdown of how bits scale up into larger units of data:

1:::1 bit (binary digit) = smallest unit of data (0 or 1)
2:::8 bits = 1 byte (B)
3:::1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)
4::1024 kilobytes = 1 megabyte (MB)
5::1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte (GB)
6::1024 gigabytes = 1 terabyte (TB)
7:::1024 terabytes = 1 petabyte (PB)
8::1024 petabytes = 1 exabyte (EB)
9::1024 exabytes = 1 zettabyte (ZB)
10:::1024 zettabytes = 1 yottabyte (YB)

Q What is Cryptography?

Ans:: -->Cryptography is the practice and study of secure
 communication techniques used to protect
  information from unauthorized access. 
  It involves creating and deciphering codes 
  to ensure data confidentiality, integrity,
  and authentication.


  Difference Between Encoding, Hashing & Cryptography::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Encoding:--> Encoding involves transforming data into another format 
using a scheme to ensure it's readable by a different system or application. 
It's not meant for security but for facilitating data transmission. Examples
 include Base64 and ASCII.

Hashing:----> Hashing is a one-way function that converts input data into a 
fixed-size string of characters, called a hash value or digest. It's used to 
verify data integrity and is irreversible. Even a small change in input data
 significantly alters the hash output.

Cryptography:----> Cryptography is a broader concept involving techniques like 
encryption and decryption to secure data during transmission or storage. Encryption
 scrambles data into ciphertext using algorithms and keys, which can be decrypted back
  to its original form by authorized parties.


  Types of Cryptography:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Symmetric Cryptography:-----> Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. 
Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).


Asymmetric Cryptography:---> Involves a pair of keys, public and private, where data
 encrypted with one key can only be decrypted by the other. Examples include RSA 
 and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

Hashing Algorithms:---> Used for data integrity verification. Common hashing 
algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.


How Cryptography Works: --------->
Cryptography operates through algorithms and keys. Encryption converts plaintext
 into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a key. Decryption uses the
  same or a corresponding  algorithm and key to convert the ciphertext back to plaintext.


  Cryptography Tools:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

OpenSSL:----> A robust open-source toolkit for SSL/TLS protocols and general-purpose
 cryptography.

GnuPG (GPG): Provides encryption and signing functions via various cryptographic
 protocols.
Crypto++: A free C++ class library of cryptographic algorithms and schemes.
Hashing Tools:

MD5 Hash Generator: Calculates the MD5 hash value of files or text inputs.

SHA-256 Online: Generates SHA-256 hash values for data input.

bcrypt: A password hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks.
Encoding Tools:

Base64 Encoder/Decoder: Converts binary data to ASCII text and vice versa.
URL Encoder/Decoder: Encodes and decodes URLs to ensure safe transmission in web protocols.
UTF-8 Encoding/Decoding: Handles encoding and decoding of Unicode characters for text representation.

About Rabbit Cipher:
Category: Stream cipher
Use Case: Efficient for environments requiring high-speed encryption, like wireless communications or embedded devices.
Strength: Known for its speed and efficiency in both software and hardware implementations. Rabbit is not a block cipher, which differentiates it from more common ciphers like AES.


// Encrypting the message using Rabbit Cipher
var encrypted = CryptoJS.Rabbit.encrypt("Message", "Secret Passphrase");
console.log(encrypted.toString());  // Displays the encrypted result

// Decrypting the message using the same passphrase
var decrypted = CryptoJS.Rabbit.decrypt(encrypted, "Secret Passphrase");

Stream Cipher: It generates a pseudorandom stream of bits (keystream) and then XORs the plaintext with this keystream to produce ciphertext.
Efficient: Rabbit is known for being fast in both software and hardware, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
eSTREAM Finalist: Rabbit was one of the four ciphers selected in the eSTREAM project after evaluating several designs for performance and security.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::   UTF-8  UTF-16  UTF-32


UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are different encoding formats used to represent Unicode characters in computer systems. They vary in terms of how many bytes they use to encode each character and how they handle different character sets. Here’s a breakdown of each:

1. UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
Encoding: Uses 1 to 4 bytes per character.
How it works:
For characters in the ASCII range (0–127), UTF-8 uses 1 byte (the same as ASCII).
For other characters, it uses 2, 3, or 4 bytes depending on the complexity of the character.
Advantages:
Efficient for Western languages (uses less space for ASCII characters).
Backward compatible with ASCII.
Widely used in the web and popular for file formats (like HTML, JSON, etc.).
Common Use: Websites, text files, and applications where storage space is a concern.
Example Encoding:
The character "A" (ASCII) = 0x41 (1 byte)
The character "€" (Euro sign) = 0xE2 0x82 0xAC (3 bytes)


2. UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
Encoding: Uses either 2 or 4 bytes per character.
How it works:
Most characters are encoded in 2 bytes (16 bits).
Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) use 4 bytes (called "surrogate pairs").
Advantages:
More efficient for Asian languages (like Chinese, Japanese) that use more non-ASCII characters.
Disadvantages:
Less efficient for text dominated by ASCII characters (like English).
Handling surrogate pairs adds complexity.
Common Use: Internal text processing for systems like Windows or Java, and file formats like Microsoft Office.
Example Encoding:
The character "A" = 0x0041 (2 bytes)
The character "𐍈" (Gothic letter) = 0xD800 0xDF48 (4 bytes)



3. UTF-32 (32-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
Encoding: Uses 4 bytes (32 bits) for every character.
How it works:
Every character, regardless of its Unicode code point, is represented with 4 bytes.
Advantages:
Very simple because every character is exactly 4 bytes, making it easy to index characters.
Disadvantages:
Memory inefficient for most texts, especially those that primarily use ASCII characters.
Common Use: Rarely used due to its inefficiency, but sometimes found in systems where fixed-width encoding is required.
Example Encoding:
The character "A" = 0x00000041 (4 bytes)
The character "𐍈" = 0x00010348 (4 bytes)


Summary of Differences:::::----------------------<><><><><><><><><><><><>
UTF-8: Variable-width (1–4 bytes), efficient for ASCII-heavy text, widely used on the web.
UTF-16: Variable-width (2–4 bytes), efficient for non-ASCII characters like those in Asian scripts, common in internal processing.
UTF-32: Fixed-width (4 bytes), simple but memory inefficient.

Use Case: Commonly used for verifying data integrity, but considered insecure for modern password storage due to vulnerability to hash collisions.


2. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):
Description: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash, often referred to as SHA-128 because of its internal structure.
Use Case: Used for digital signatures and certificates, but also considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for collisions.


3. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2):
SHA-256: Produces a 256-bit hash value. It’s part of the SHA-2 family and offers stronger security compared to SHA-1.
Use Case: Commonly used in blockchain technologies (e.g., Bitcoin), SSL certificates, and secure password hashing.


4. SHA-512:
Description: Produces a 512-bit hash, part of the SHA-2 family.

12. PHPS (PHP Hashing):
Description: Refers to PHP’s built-in password hashing functions, such as password_hash(), which uses bcrypt by default.
Use Case: PHP’s secure password hashing is essential for web development, ensuring strong protection against brute-force attacks by using salting and automatic algorithm selection.

CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check):
Description: Not a cryptographic hash but an error-detecting code commonly used in network communications and file integrity checks.
Use Case: Ensures data integrity during transmission and storage, but is not secure for cryptographic purposes.
