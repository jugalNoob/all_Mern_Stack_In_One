🧠 Why Elastic Developed Elasticsearch?
Shay Banon created Elasticsearch because he needed a scalable, distributed, and fast search engine for a personal project (his wife’s recipe app).

At that time, no open-source solution had:

Distributed indexing

Real-time search

Easy REST API

JSON document support

So he built it — and it exploded in popularity.

🎯 Why Companies Use Elasticsearch (And Pay Elastic)
Unmatched Search Performance:

Sub-second search over millions of records.

Built-in full-text, fuzzy, geolocation, autocomplete, etc.

Real-Time Log and Event Analytics:

ELK Stack is now an industry standard for monitoring and observability (alternative to Splunk or Datadog).

Flexible Integration:

Works with virtually all programming languages and cloud platforms.

Open Source + Commercial:

Core is open-source.

Elastic offers commercial features (security, ML, alerting) through their Elastic Cloud or self-hosted X-Pack.

⚠️ Some companies have moved to OpenSearch (a fork by AWS) after Elastic changed its license in 2021 from Apache 2.0 to SSPL.

🔐 Elastic Licensing Note
Until 2021, Elasticsearch was fully open source (Apache 2.0).

Elastic changed it to SSPL (Server Side Public License) to prevent cloud vendors (like AWS) from selling it without contributing back.

In response, Amazon forked it into OpenSearch — a fully open-source alternative maintained by AWS.

✅ Summary
Elastic N.V. is the company behind Elasticsearch.

They offer both free (basic) and paid (enterprise) features.

Elasticsearch is used by thousands of companies for real-time search, logging, and analytics.

Elastic makes money through Elastic Cloud, support plans, and advanced features.
