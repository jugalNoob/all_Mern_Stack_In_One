Sorting and limiting results (.sort(), .limit())

✅ Schema Basics

Understanding JSON-like document structure

Embedded vs referenced documents

Nested fields and arrays

✅ Indexes

Single-field indexes

Unique indexes

Basic knowledge of index impact on queries

✅ Tools

✅ Node.js Integration

Using MongoDB driver or Mongoose

Basic connection and simple operations

2. Intermediate / Production Skills

✅ Aggregation Framework

$match, $group, $project, $sort, $limit, $skip

$lookup, $unwind for joins

Using pipelines for reporting and analytics

✅ Transactions

Multi-document transactions in replica sets

Using startSession(), startTransaction(), commitTransaction(), abortTransaction()

✅ Indexes (Advanced)

Compound indexes

Covered queries

Index direction (asc/desc)

TTL (time-to-live) indexes for expiring data

✅ Data Modeling

One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships

Embedding vs referencing trade-offs

Shard keys

Ranges vs hashed sharding

Balancing shards

✅ Mongoose (Node.js)

Schemas, validations, default values

Pre/post middleware/hooks

Population (.populate()) for references

3. Advanced / Expert Skills

Optimizing queries with indexes

Analyzing slow queries with profiler

✅ Advanced Replication & Sharding

Multi-region deployments

Handling replica set failovers

Shard key selection for optimal distribution

✅ Scaling Strategies

Horizontal scaling with sharding

Read/write splitting

Caching strategies (Redis + MongoDB)

✅ Monitoring & Security

mongostat, mongotop for metrics

Backups & point-in-time recovery

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Encryption at rest and in transit

✅ Change Streams & Event-Driven Architecture

Real-time updates via watch()

Integration with Kafka or microservices

✅ Transactions at Scale

Retryable transactions

Handling transient network errors

Multi-collection, multi-database transactions

✅ Advanced Node.js Integration

Connection pooling & session handling

4. Real-World Application Examples

E-commerce: Orders, inventory, payment logs, transactional updates

Banking: Account transfers, balance updates, multi-document transactions

Analytics: Aggregation pipelines for dashboards and metrics

Social Media: Embedding vs referencing posts and comments

Real-time apps: Using change streams + Socket.io or Kafka
