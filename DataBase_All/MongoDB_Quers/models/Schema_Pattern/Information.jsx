| Model   | Pattern       | Reason / Use Case                              |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User    | Discriminator | Role-based fields (Admin vs Customer)          |
| Profile | Outlier       | Large/volatile info separate from User         |
| Product | Embedded      | Specs, tags, images tightly coupled            |
| Order   | Referenced    | References Product & User to avoid duplication |
| Review  | Polymorphic   | Review can belong to multiple models           |
| Log     | Bucket        | Time-series data grouped by date               |

| Pattern       | Use Case Example             | Pros                               | Cons                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Embedded      | Product specs, user settings | Fast reads, atomic writes          | Can grow large, update issues   |
| Referenced    | Orders referencing products  | Normalize data, avoids duplication | Requires populate (extra query) |
| Bucket        | Logs, time-series data       | Query optimization, reduces count  | Complex querying, size limits   |
| Outlier       | User profile info            | Keeps main doc small, easy updates | Extra join needed               |
| Polymorphic   | Reviews on products/orders   | Reusable schemas, clean logic      | Complex refs, needs `refPath`   |
| Discriminator | Admin vs Customer users      | Shared base schema + customization | Slightly heavier model logic    |
