🧠 What is GitLab?
GitLab is a complete DevSecOps platform delivered as a single application, enabling teams to perform all stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC): Plan → Create → Verify → Package → Release → Configure → Monitor → Secure.

It’s similar to GitHub or Bitbucket but has built-in CI/CD and stronger DevOps integration.
