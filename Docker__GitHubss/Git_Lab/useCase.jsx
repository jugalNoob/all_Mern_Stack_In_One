🚀 1. Source Code Management (SCM)
Use Case: Host and version-control your code
Example: A team of developers working on a Node.js app uses GitLab to:

Push/pull code from central repo

Review merge requests (MRs)

Enforce code quality via linting

✅ Similar to GitHub but more integrated with CI/CD.

⚙️ 2. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment)
Use Case: Automate testing, building, and deployment
Example:

After a developer pushes code, GitLab CI/CD pipeline runs:

✅ Tests via Jest/Mocha

📦 Builds React frontend

🚀 Deploys to staging or production on Vercel/AWS

🛠️ Uses .gitlab-ci.yml for pipeline configuration.

🔒 3. DevSecOps Integration
Use Case: Detect vulnerabilities in code during CI
Example: A fintech company integrates GitLab’s SAST (Static Application Security Testing) to catch vulnerable packages (like outdated express or lodash) on each push.

📊 4. Issue Tracking & Project Management
Use Case: Manage tasks and development workflows
Example: A team building a mobile app uses:

Issues → for bugs & features

Labels → for categorization

Boards → like Trello/Kanban

Epics → for larger goals

✅ Combines Jira + GitHub Projects features.

👥 5. Team Collaboration
Use Case: Coordinate large teams or open-source contributions
Example:

GitLab Groups manage permissions per team (Frontend, Backend)

Merge Request Approvals required before merging code

In-line code reviews streamline feedback

🌐 6. Self-Hosted GitLab (on-premise)
Use Case: Organizations with compliance/security needs
Example: A healthcare firm hosts GitLab on their private servers to comply with HIPAA regulations.

✅ Gives full control over infrastructure and data privacy.

💼 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) + GitOps
Use Case: Manage cloud infra with Git
Example:

DevOps teams store Terraform/Ansible configs in GitLab

Pipelines auto-apply changes to AWS infrastructure

GitOps ensures infra is always in sync with Git state

📦 8. Container Registry + Kubernetes
Use Case: Manage Docker images alongside your code
Example:

A microservices project pushes built Docker images to GitLab’s Container Registry

Deploys apps directly to GitLab-managed Kubernetes clusters

🔐 9. Access Control & Audit
Use Case: Control who can view/modify code
Example:

Backend devs only access the api/ folder

Admins monitor activity logs and approval history

✅ Enforces role-based access & traceability for audits.
