ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Go to your project folder

Open PowerShell or terminal and navigate to your project:

cd "C:\Users\sjuga\Pictures\MernAll_Project_DeReaM\All_In_One_MernStack\Docker__GitHubss\Git_Lab"

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Initialize Git (if not done)
git init

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Add GitLab remote

If a remote already exists, remove it first:

git remote remove origin


Then add your GitLab repository URL:

git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/jugalnoob-group/node-express.git

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Create main branch
git checkout -b main

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Add and commit files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"


This stages all your files and makes the first commit.

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Pull remote changes (if main already exists)

If GitLab repo already has some commits:

git pull origin main --rebase


This fetches remote changes and applies your local commits on top.

Resolve conflicts if any.

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Push to GitLab
git push -u origin main


âœ… Now your files should be uploaded to GitLab â†’ node-express repo.

ðŸ”¹ Optional: Use a branch for safety

Instead of pushing directly to main (especially if itâ€™s protected):

git checkout -b my-feature
git push -u origin my-feature


Then go to GitLab â†’ Merge Requests â†’ merge my-feature into main.

If you want, I can also make a copy-paste ready command list for Windows so you can upload your whole MERN project to GitLab without any errors.

Do you want me to do that?
