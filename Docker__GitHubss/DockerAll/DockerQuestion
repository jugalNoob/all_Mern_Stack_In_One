1. Introduction to Docker
What is Docker?

A platform for automating the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

History and Development :::::::::-----
Created by Solomon Hykes and released in 2013.
Built on containerization technology like LXC.

. Installation and Setup ::::::::::--

Installing Docker

Installing Docker on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Docker Desktop
Using Docker Desktop for local development and testing.
Docker CLI
Basic commands for interacting with Docker (docker run, docker ps, docker stop).


 Docker Architecture  ::::::----------
Docker Engine
Understanding Docker Daemon, CLI, and Docker Registry.

Images and Containers
Difference between images and containers.

Dockerfile
Writing Dockerfiles to create custom Docker images.


Working with Docker Images ::::::::::---
Docker Hub
Pulling images from Docker Hub.

Building Images
Using docker build to create images from Dockerfiles.

Managing Images
Listing, tagging, and removing images (docker images, docker rmi).


Working with Docker Containers ::::::::::::::-------
Running Containers
Starting, stopping, and removing containers (docker run, docker stop, docker rm).

Container Lifecycle
Managing the lifecycle of containers (start, stop, pause, unpause, restart).

Inspecting Containers
Viewing container details using docker inspect


. Docker Networking :::::::: ----------
Networking Basics
Understanding Docker networks (bridge, host, overlay).

Creating Networks
Creating and managing Docker networks (docker network create, docker network ls).

Connecting Containers
Linking and communicating between containers in different networks.



Docker Volumes ::::::::::::---------------
Data Persistence
Using volumes to persist data between container restarts.

Creating and Managing Volumes
Commands for volume management (docker volume create, docker volume ls, docker volume rm).

Mounting Volumes
Mounting volumes to containers for data storage.




 Docker Compose :::::::::::::::----------
Introduction to Docker Compose
Defining multi-container applications with docker-compose.yml.

Compose Commands
Using docker-compose commands (docker-compose up, docker-compose down).

Service Configuration
Configuring services, networks, and volumes in Docker Compose.



Docker Swarm ::::::::::::----------

Introduction to Docker Swarm
Native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker.

Swarm Mode
Initializing and managing a Docker Swarm cluster.

Deploying Services
Using docker service commands to deploy and manage services in Swarm.



. Kubernetes
Introduction to Kubernetes
Overview of Kubernetes as an orchestration tool.

Docker and Kubernetes Integration
Using Docker with Kubernetes (kubectl, minikube, kubeadm).



Docker Security ::::::::::::::------------------
Security Best Practices
Ensuring secure Docker images and containers.

User Management
Managing users and permissions within containers.

Securing the Docker Daemon
Best practices for securing the Docker daemon and API.


Docker for Development :::::::::::::::::---------------
Development Workflows
Using Docker for development environments and CI/CD pipelines.

Debugging and Logging
Debugging Docker containers and accessing logs (docker logs).



Docker for Production:::::::::::::::::--------------------

Deploying to Production
Best practices for deploying Docker containers in production environments.

Scaling Applications
Scaling applications using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Monitoring and Logging
Tools for monitoring container performance and collecting logs (Prometheus, ELK stack).


Advanced Docker Topics :::::::::::::::::---------------------
Multi-Stage Builds
Creating optimized images with multi-stage builds in Dockerfile.

Docker Secrets and Configs
Managing sensitive data with Docker secrets and configurations.

Docker Plugins
Using and creating Docker plugins for extended functionality.



Docker Ecosystem and Tools ::::::::::::::::---------------------
Docker Hub
Public and private image repositories.

Docker Compose
Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker Machine
Tool for managing Docker hosts (deprecated but useful historically).

Docker Registry
Setting up private registries to store Docker images.
