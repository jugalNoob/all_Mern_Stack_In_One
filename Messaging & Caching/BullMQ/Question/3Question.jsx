1) Failed jobs & DLQ (Dead-Letter Queue) design

::How BullMQ marks failures

A job fails if your processor throws/rejects or exceeds timeout.

BullMQ increments attemptsMade and, if < attempts, re-queues with the chosen backoff.

When retries are exhausted, the job moves to the failed set.

::DLQ pattern (recommended)

BullMQ doesn’t create a separate DLQ automatically—you design one. Common pattern:

Create a second queue (e.g., email:dlq).

When a job finally fails (after all attempts), copy its context into the DLQ with metadata (reason, stack, attemptsMade, originalId), then remove or keep the original failed record for forensics.




import { Queue, QueueEvents } from "bullmq";
const mainQueue = new Queue("email");
const dlq = new Queue("email:dlq");
const events = new QueueEvents("email");

events.on("failed", async ({ jobId, failedReason }) => {
  const job = await mainQueue.getJob(jobId);
  if (!job) return;

  const attempts = job.attemptsMade ?? 0;
  const max = job.opts.attempts ?? 1;

  if (attempts >= max) {
    await dlq.add("dlq-item", {
      originalId: job.id,
      name: job.name,
      data: job.data,
      failedReason,
      attemptsMade: attempts,
      ts: Date.now(),
    }, { removeOnComplete: true });
    // Optionally keep failed in main queue for debugging, or:
    // await job.remove();
  }
});

Optionally add a “replayer”

A small admin task that reads from email:dlq and replays selected jobs back
 to email after you’ve fixed the root cause.


2) Scaling across multiple Node.js instances

Run many Worker processes (containers/PM2/K8s pods). All connect to the same Redis.

BullMQ coordinates safely via atomic Redis ops + job locks; each job is claimed by exactly one worker at a time.

For very high throughput:

Use separate Redis for BullMQ (don’t share with app cache).

Shard queues by feature or tenant (e.g., email:priority-high, email:priority-low).

Use Redis Cluster/Sentinel for HA and horizontal capacity.





3) Distributed job processing with multiple workers

Ans:Many workers subscribe to the same queue.

A job transitions waiting → active atomically; once locked, no other worker can grab it.

Workers keep a heartbeat/lock renewal while processing.

When finished, the worker acks (moves to completed/failed), releasing the lock.



4) Worker crash during processing → recovery

Ans:If a worker dies mid-job, its lock stops renewing.

After the lock duration elapses, BullMQ marks the job stalled and re-queues it.

The job is then picked up by another healthy worker and retried (stalled count is tracked; if it stalls too many times, it’s failed).

TL;DR: At-least-once delivery semantics—so make your processors idempotent.




5) Job locking & duplicate prevention

Ans::When a worker takes a job, BullMQ sets a lock key (with TTL ≈ lockDuration, commonly ~30s).

The worker renews this lock periodically during processing.

As long as the lock is valid, other workers cannot process that job.

If the same job is accidentally enqueued multiple times, locking won’t stop that—use a dedup key pattern:

Put a natural id (e.g., email:{userId}:{template}:{date}) in jobId, or

Maintain a Redis key that you SETNX before adding a job, clearing it when processed.

// Dedup via fixed jobId:
await queue.add("sendEmail", payload, { jobId: `email:${userId}:${template}:${day}` });





6) Priority + Concurrency + Rate limiting (together)

Priority is per job (opts.priority, lower number → higher priority).

Concurrency is per worker (new Worker(..., { concurrency: N })).

Rate limiting is per worker (e.g., max: 100, duration: 1000 → 100 jobs/sec total for that worker).

import { Worker } from "bullmq";

const worker = new Worker(
  "email",
  async (job) => { /* ... */ },
  {
    concurrency: 20,
    limiter: { max: 100, duration: 1000 } // ~100/sec across this worker
  }
);

// Enqueue with priorities:
await queue.add("send", dataVIP, { priority: 1 });
await queue.add("send", dataNormal, { priority: 10 });


Tip: For strict SLOs, split queues by priority and give more workers to the high-priority queue.




7) Monitoring in production

Dashboards

Ans::ull Board / Arena for quick visibility (active, delayed, failed, retry, job payloads).

Wire up QueueEvents to push lifecycle events to logs or a stream.

Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)
Track at least:

bull_jobs_processed_total (labels: queue, status)

bull_jobs_inflight (active gauge)

bull_jobs_delayed / bull_jobs_waiting

bull_job_duration_ms (histogram for completed)

bull_failures_total (labels: reason)

Redis metrics: ops/sec, mem, keyspace hits/misses, latency.

Minimal Prometheus example:

import client from "prom-client";
import fastify from "fastify";

const app = fastify();
const reg = new client.Registry();
client.collectDefaultMetrics({ register: reg });

const processed = new client.Counter({
  name: "bull_jobs_processed_total",
  help: "Jobs processed",
  labelNames: ["queue", "status"],
});
reg.registerMetric(processed);

events.on("completed", ({ jobId }) => processed.inc({ queue: "email", status: "completed" }));
events.on("failed",    ({ jobId }) => processed.inc({ queue: "email", status: "failed" }));

app.get("/metrics", async (_, reply) => {
  reply.header("Content-Type", reg.contentType);
  return reg.metrics();
});

app.listen({ port: 9100 });

8) Common performance bottlenecks & optimizations

Bottlenecks

Single Redis instance saturated (CPU or network), slow Lua scripts.

Huge job payloads (serialization cost, network time).

Excessive progress updates or getJobs() polling.

CPU-heavy handlers blocking Node’s event loop.

Unbounded growth of completed/failed sets.

Fixes

Separate Redis for BullMQ (avoid competing with cache/session).

Scale horizontally: more workers, and/or Redis Cluster.

Keep job data small; store big blobs elsewhere and pass references.

Use sandboxed processors (separate Node process) for CPU-heavy tasks.

Reduce churn: removeOnComplete: true, removeOnFail: <max>; batch cleanup via queue.clean().

Don’t spam updateProgress; send coarse updates.

Avoid list-page UIs that call getJobs() in tight loops; use QueueEvents.

Tune Redis (network buffers, tcp-keepalive, persistence settings like appendfsync everysec if using AOF).




9) Designing for high throughput (millions of jobs/day)

Ans:::-->>></max>Core principles

Shard by domain/tenant/priority: many queues spread across Redis Cluster masters.

Idempotent processors; embrace at-least-once semantics.

Stateless workers; autoscale on K8s/nomad; one image per queue type.

DLQ with replay tooling + alerting.

Small payloads, pass IDs/URLs to data in object storage/DB.

Observability first (metrics + logs + tracing).

Reference layout

Redis:

Dedicated BullMQ cluster (3–6 masters), reserved CPU/RAM, persistence tuned.

Queues:

email-high, email-low, webhooks, exports, ml-infer, etc.

Optionally shard within a type: webhooks:shard-0..N (route by hash of customerId).

Workers:

Each queue has its own deployment; start with concurrency=16..64 per pod.

Apply rate limiters where you call external APIs.

Use sandboxed processors for CPU work; or offload to a separate service.

Producer/API:

Enqueue with stable jobId for dedup where applicable.

Use priority for VIP/SLO paths.

Ops:

Prometheus alerts (lag, failures, stalled spikes, Redis latency).

Automated DLQ replayer gated by feature flags.

Scheduled clean() and TTL on completed/failed.

Example worker template

import { Worker } from "bullmq";

export const worker = new Worker(
  "webhooks:shard-3",
  async (job) => {
    // fetch payload by ID, call external service, handle 429 with backoff
  },
  {
    concurrency: 32,
    limiter: { max: 500, duration: 1000 }, // ~500/s per pod
    // lockDuration/timeout tuned for your typical job time
  }
);

🔹 System Design + Scenario-Based

Design a system using BullMQ where:

API receives image uploads.

Images must be resized into multiple formats.

Each task should retry on failure with exponential backoff.

Must support priority for "premium users".

How would you design a BullMQ + Kafka + Redis setup for processing real-time events at scale?

If Redis goes down, what happens to BullMQ? How do you design for high availability?

Suppose you have 100k jobs per minute with different processing times. How would you partition queues and scale workers?

How would you implement a delayed retry queue where jobs should retry after 1h, 2h, 4h, etc. (custom backoff strategy)?
