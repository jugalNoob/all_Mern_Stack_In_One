Awesome, Jugal! You're building an incredibly detailed and complete BullMQ reference. Here's a clean structure you can follow and expand upon further if you decide to turn this into a doc, GitHub guide, or blog:

üî• BullMQ Complete Reference Guide
1Ô∏è‚É£ Queues
Queue creation with Redis

add(), addBulk()

Auto-removal with removeOnComplete, removeOnFail

Prioritized jobs

Job deduplication

Rate limit config (per group, global)

drain(), obliterate(), pause(), resume()

2Ô∏è‚É£ Workers
Job processors

Concurrency: concurrency: 5

Graceful shutdown

Sandboxed processors

Rate limiting in workers

Worker.RateLimitError()

Retry/backoff logic (attempts, delay, jitter)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Jobs
FIFO / LIFO (lifo: true)

Job ID, job data update

Deduplication (deduplication: { id, ttl, extend, replace })

Delay (delay: 5000)

Repeatable jobs (cron, interval, limits)

Priority queueing

job.remove(), job.updateData(), job.changePriority()

4Ô∏è‚É£ Job Scheduling
repeat with cron or interval

QueueScheduler to manage repeatable jobs

Pausing/Resuming queues

Canceling or removing repeat jobs

5Ô∏è‚É£ Flows (Job Trees / Dependencies)
Creating flows and sub-jobs

getFlowTree() to inspect

failParent, continueParent, ignoreDependency, removeChildDependency

6Ô∏è‚É£ Metrics
Prometheus integration

Job counts, durations

Completed/failed tracking

7Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting
Per-worker limits (limiter: { max, duration })

Per-group limits (groupKey: 'userId')

External rate limit signals (worker.rateLimit(duration))

8Ô∏è‚É£ Parallelism & Concurrency
Worker-level parallel job execution

CPU-efficient concurrency tuning

9Ô∏è‚É£ Retries and Backoff
attempts, backoff: { type: 'fixed' | 'exponential' }

Jitter (randomness) support

üîü Returning Results
return result from worker

Listen with QueueEvents.on('completed', ...)

job.returnvalue

11Ô∏è‚É£ Events
Built-in events: completed, failed, stalled, waiting, etc.

Custom events: queueEventsProducer.publishEvent(...)

Typed listeners with TypeScript support

12Ô∏è‚É£ Telemetry
BullMQOtel integration

Jaeger/OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

Tracing queue operations and worker execution

üì¶ Suggested Additions
Bull Board UI for job monitoring

Dead-letter queue handling

Job cleanup scripts (batch deletion, scheduled cleanup)

Admin dashboard API (pause, resume, clean, etc.)

‚úÖ Bonus Tools
QueueScheduler: required for retries, delays, repeatables

QueueEvents: listen to job lifecycle events

Job: utility for interacting with job instances (Job.fromId())
