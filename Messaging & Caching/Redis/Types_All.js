🔁 1. Caching (Most Popular Use Case)
Goal: Reduce latency and database load.

🔹 Examples:
Session storage (e.g., user login sessions)

Page or API caching (e.g., caching blog posts or product lists)

Database query result caching

Content delivery caching (CDNs)

📊 2. Real-Time Analytics / Counters
Goal: Fast aggregation and analytics in real-time.

🔹 Examples:
Page views, likes, votes tracking

Trending topics counter

Real-time leaderboards (e.g., using ZINCRBY on sorted sets)

Rate limiting (tokens per user/IP per time window)

⏱ 3. Rate Limiting / Throttling
Goal: Prevent abuse by limiting API usage or actions.

🔹 Methods:
Fixed Window Counter

Sliding Window Log

Token Bucket

Leaky Bucket

E.g., “Only allow 10 requests per minute per user.”

📧 4. Queue / Message Broker
Goal: Asynchronous processing using queues or pub/sub.

🔹 Methods:
LPUSH + BRPOP: Simple job queues

PUB/SUB: Real-time messaging

Streams (Redis 5+): Kafka-like durable message queues

Use case: background jobs, task queues, chat messages

🗃 5. Session Management
Goal: Store user sessions with fast access and expiration.

🔹 Examples:
Authentication tokens

Shopping carts

Temporary preferences

Often used with libraries like express-session in Node.js.

🔍 6. Search and Autocomplete
Goal: Implement fast prefix-based search.

🔹 Techniques:
Trie-like structures using Sorted Sets

Incremental matching

E.g., Google-style autocomplete for search input fields.

🕵️ 7. Geospatial Indexing
Goal: Location-based services.

🔹 Commands:
GEOADD, GEORADIUS, GEODIST

🔹 Examples:
Find nearby restaurants

Track delivery agents

Geofencing

⏳ 8. Expire-based Key/Value Data (TTL)
Goal: Store temporary data with automatic expiration.

🔹 Examples:
OTPs

Temporary links or invites

Captcha tokens

📦 9. Data Structure Store
Goal: Leverage advanced in-memory data types.

🔹 Built-in types:
Strings

Lists

Hashes

Sets

Sorted Sets

Bitmaps

HyperLogLogs

Streams

E.g., store a user profile as a Hash, or a chat history as a List.

📈 10. Real-Time Leaderboards
Goal: Track and rank players or entities.

🔹 Use:
ZADD, ZREVRANGE, ZINCRBY

Example: Gaming scores, top contributors

🔗 11. Pub/Sub Messaging
Goal: Decouple systems using publisher/subscriber pattern.

🔹 Use case:
Chat applications

Notification systems

Event broadcasting

Redis Pub/Sub is ephemeral (messages not persisted).

📉 12. Data Expiry & Delayed Jobs
Goal: Trigger actions after certain time intervals.

🔹 Techniques:
Set TTL on job key

Use Redis with tools like BullMQ or Celery

E.g., auto-expire cart, delayed emails, password reset link expiry

🧠 13. Machine Learning & AI
Goal: Store intermediate ML results or feature store.

🔹 Use:
Model features in memory

ML inference cache

Model version control (via Hashes/Sets)

🔄 14. Replication / High Availability / Clustering
Goal: Ensure data availability and scalability.

🔹 Features:
Master-slave replication

Redis Sentinel (failover)

Redis Cluster (sharding & partitioning)

👥 15. User Activity & Presence Tracking
Goal: Track online/offline status or last activity.

🔹 Examples:
Show “last seen”

“Currently typing…” indicators

Active users in a chatroom

🧾 16. Shopping Cart / Inventory Management
Goal: Manage stock, item counts, and cart data.

Using Hashes or Lists per user/cart.

🧪 17. Testing & Development Utilities
Goal: Ephemeral data for mock environments.

🔹 Examples:
Store test tokens

Temporary user data

Rate limit simulation
