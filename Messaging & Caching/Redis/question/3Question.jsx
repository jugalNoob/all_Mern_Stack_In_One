ðŸ”¹ Advanced Redis Questions
1. How does Redis achieve high performance (event loop, single-threaded model)?

Redis is single-threaded (per process) but extremely fast because:

Uses epoll/kqueue event loop (non-blocking I/O).

In-memory data structures â†’ O(1)/O(logN) operations.

Avoids context-switching overhead of multi-threading.

Network I/O handled asynchronously.

Redis 6+ introduced I/O threading for networking, but command execution is still single-threaded.
ðŸ‘‰ This design minimizes race conditions and makes Redis predictable under load.





2. What are Redis modules (e.g., RedisJSON, RedisSearch, RedisBloom)?

Redis modules extend Redis beyond basic key-value store:

RedisJSON â†’ store/query JSON documents (NoSQL-like).

RedisSearch â†’ full-text search, secondary indexing.

RedisBloom â†’ probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters, Count-Min sketch).

RedisTimeSeries â†’ optimized for time-series data.
ðŸ‘‰ Modules turn Redis into a multi-model database while keeping high performance.





3. How do you implement a rate limiter in Redis?

Common approaches:

Fixed Window Counter â†’ INCR a key with expiry â†’ block if exceeds limit.

Sliding Window / Leaky Bucket â†’ use sorted sets (timestamps) to track requests within time window.
ðŸ‘‰ Example:

INCR user:123:requests
EXPIRE user:123:requests 60


Limits user 123 to N requests per 60s.
ðŸ‘‰ Used for API rate limiting, login protection, DDoS prevention.




4. How would you implement a leaderboard using Redis Sorted Sets?

Use Sorted Set (ZSET) where:

Member = userId

Score = points/rank

Commands:

ZADD leaderboard 100 user1 â†’ add/update score.

ZRANGE leaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES â†’ top 10 players.

ZREVRANK leaderboard user1 â†’ rank of user.
ðŸ‘‰ Sorted Sets = perfect for gaming leaderboards, trending items, top-N queries.




5. How do you monitor Redis performance (latency, memory fragmentation, cache hit ratio)?

Tools:

INFO command â†’ stats about memory, clients, hits/misses.

MONITOR â†’ logs all commands (debugging).

redis-cli --latency â†’ track latency.

Memory fragmentation ratio â†’ reported by INFO memory (used_memory_rss / used_memory).

Cache hit ratio â†’ keyspace_hits / (keyspace_hits+keyspace_misses).

External: RedisInsight, Prometheus + Grafana.




6. How do you handle cache stampede in Redis?

Cache stampede = when many requests hit DB because cache expired. Solutions:

Mutex lock â†’ first request regenerates cache, others wait.

Cache pre-warming â†’ refresh cache proactively.

Staggered TTL â†’ add randomness to expiry times to avoid mass expiry.

Read-through / Write-through caching â†’ keep cache always updated automatically.




7. What is the difference between cold cache, warm cache, and cache-aside strategies?

Cold cache â†’ cache starts empty â†’ high DB load until warmed.

Warm cache â†’ cache pre-populated before use â†’ fast from start.

Cache-aside (lazy loading):

App checks cache â†’ if miss â†’ fetch DB â†’ write to cache.

Most common in Redis.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: use cache-aside for DB queries, write-through for real-time consistency.




8. How does Redis handle persistence + HA in Kubernetes or cloud environments?

Persistence:

RDB snapshots or AOF logs stored in PVCs (Persistent Volumes).

HA:

Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for failover.

Cloud providers (AWS Elasticache, GCP Memorystore, Azure Cache) offer managed HA.

Kubernetes:

StatefulSets + Helm charts (Bitnami/Redis Operator).

Pod disruption budgets + anti-affinity rules for node failure handling.





9. What are Redis transactions vs Lua scripting â€“ when to use which?

Transactions (MULTI/EXEC) â†’ batch of commands executed sequentially. No rollback.

Lua scripting (EVAL) â†’ run custom logic atomically on Redis server.

Eliminates round-trips.

Useful for complex operations (e.g., conditional updates, distributed locks).
ðŸ‘‰ Use Lua when you need atomic + custom logic in one execution.




10. How would you debug and fix a Redis OOM command not allowed error?

Happens when:

Redis reaches maxmemory and eviction policy doesnâ€™t allow more inserts.

Fixes:

Check memory via INFO memory.

Set eviction policy (maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru etc.).

Increase memory limit.

Optimize data structures (use Hashes for small objects, compression).
ðŸ‘‰ Example: In caching mode, set allkeys-lru so Redis evicts least-used keys instead of throwing OOM.
