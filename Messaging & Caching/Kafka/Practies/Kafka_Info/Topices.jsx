Producer: Publishes messages to topics.

Consumer: Reads messages from topics, tracks offsets

Topic: Named stream of messages, divided into partitions.

Partition: Ordered, append-only sequence offering parallelism and scalability

Broker: Kafka server that stores partitions.

Cluster: Group of brokers; one acts as Controller, managing partition assignments

üìö 2. Kafka Architecture & Features
Distributed log: Durable, replayable event storage.

High-throughput & low-latency: Efficient via batched I/O and memory-sequential writes

Retention & log compaction: Manage data lifecycle with time/size policies or compaction

.

Exactly-once semantics: Through idempotence, transactions, and coordination.

üî© 3. Core APIs
Producer API: Send messages to topics.

Consumer API: Fetch messages, manage offsets.

Streams API: In-app stream processing with DSL and state

.

Admin API: Manage topics, ACLs, partitions programmatically.

Schema Registry: Manage message schemas and compatibility.

Log compaction: Maintain latest state per key.

Transactions: To ensure multi-topic, exactly-once writes.

Stream processing patterns: Joins, windowing, enrichment via Streams API.

Connectors: Integrate with Kafka Connect ecosystem.

Security: TLS, authentication (SASL), ACLs encryption.

üß™ 6. Getting Started (Hands-On)
Install Kafka (with ZooKeeper or KRaft).

Create a topic: kafka-topics.sh --create ‚Ä¶

Start Producer: kafka-console-producer.sh ‚Ä¶

Start Consumer: kafka-console-consumer.sh ‚Ä¶
Interact live with command-line tools.

üèóÔ∏è 7. Best Practices & Production Setup
Choose sensible Partition + Replication counts.

Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana.

Implement idempotent producers and consumer commit strategies.

Design error-handling and retry logic.

Secure your cluster (TLS, ACLs, network-level restrictions).

Fully test with integration and resilience scenarios.

üìà 8. Learning Journey & Resources
Beginner ‚Üí Pro Path:

Concepts: Producers, consumers, topics, partitions.

Advanced: Streams, Connect, transactions, compaction.

Architecture: Brokers, controllers, KRaft, schema registry.

Tooling: Monitoring, CI/CD, ops automation.

Coding: Java/Node/Python samples using APIs.

Production: Security, resilience, backups, layout.

‚úÖ Summary
Topics, partitions, brokers form the backbone of Kafka.

Consumers & producers interact using pull-model with offset control.

Streams and Connect provide powerful processing/integration capabilities.

Advanced clusters use replication, security, schema management, and monitoring.

Kafka is both a messaging platform and a real-time data backbone.
